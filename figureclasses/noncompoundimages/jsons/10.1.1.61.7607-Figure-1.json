The\nmore and larger cycles C contains and i belongs to, the bigger\nscore i will come up with. However, cycles do not usually exist\nin bibliometrics, but if they do so, they are usually self-citations.\nThus, it is not fair for the self-citations to affect the score positively.\nOn the other hand, removing the self-citations or the cycles will\ninvalidate the graph and the results. Thus, PageRank could not be\nfair. This is verified by the graph instance with 12 nodes of Figure\n1 and the results of Table 1, where we depict the ranking score for\neach node by applying all the ranking methods. Table 1 consists of\nfive columns. Each column presents the ranking by the appropriate\nmethod and includes 2 sub-columns. Sub-column 1 is the node id\nand sub-column 2 is the node score rounded to 2 decimal digits. In\nthis example, node 0 gets 4 citations, while nodes 10 and 6 get 3\ncitations each. However, the PageRank score of nodes 10 and 6 is\nabout 3 times higher than the score of node 0. This happens because\nnodes 10 and 6 are parts of citation cycles.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[184,553,297,566],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[89,451,393,542]}
