Instance-based algorithms are robust to\nnoisy or extreme input feature (predictor) values since\nthe query instances will be far from these instances\nand their effect will be very small. However, if the tar-\nget values of training instances are noisy, this situation\nmust be handled.\nWe have modified the RPFP algorithm, by chang-\ning only the feature prediction phase, described in\nSection 3.1.2 in order to cope with noisy target values.\nRPFP-N employs an averaging procedure, instead of\nweighted linear least squares approximation for feature\nprediction. This is distance weighted median measure\nand its algorithm is described in Fig. 7, which is used\nfor both categorical and continuous features. For cat-\negorical features, the instances which are in the same\ncategory with the feature value of the query instance\nare used for computation of both feature prediction and\nlocal weights. In the algorithm, Eq. (19) is used as the\nweight function for feature prediction.\nAfter determining the prediction for a feature; in or-\nder to determine its local weight, Eq. (22) is employed\nin Eqs. (20) and (21), for both categorical and continues\nfeatures.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[96,325,275,337],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[96,125,415,313]}
