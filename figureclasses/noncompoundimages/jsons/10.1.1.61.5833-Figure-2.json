{"Caption":"Figure 2: Example binary problem where points belonging to the A+ and A− sets are represented by blue circles and red triangles respectively. Note that two elements xi and xj of the set A− are not correctly ordered and hence generate positive values of the corresponding slack variables yi and yj . Note that the point xk (hollow triangle) is in the convex hull of the set A− and hence the corresponding yk error can be writen as a convex combination (yk = λki yi + λkj yj ) of the two nonzero errors corresponding to points of A− ","ImageText":[],"Mention":[") to also be a convex combination of y (see Fig. 2). For example, this implies that\n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,263,675,351],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[341,99,510,252]}
