We simulated an ISP network\nwith 16 OD routers and measured both PTM and FTM once every\n10 seconds using 1024K buckets. Figure 2 illustrates the estimated\nvs. actual PTM elements in 5 runs. The solid diagonal line shows\nequality and the doted line shows \u00065%. As most points are clustered\naround the diagonal, our CBTM scheme achieves a very accurate es-\ntimation of PTM. The average relative error is 2:4% while the largest\nrelative error is 19% for a small PTM element of actual 137; 584\npackets. When PTM elements become larger, the estimation tends to\nbe much more accurate. Similarly, Figure 2 shows the estimated vs.\nactual FTM elements. Our scheme also estimates FTM very accu-\nrately although FTM elements are much smaller than those of PTM.\nThe average relative error is 2:78% for all elements while the largest\nrelative error is 27% for an small FTM element of actual 1; 450 \u0003ows.\nIn summary, the CBTM scheme can estimate both PTM and FTM\nin almost real-time (once every 10 seconds) with low average relative\nerrors (less than 5%). Our performance study also shows that each\npacket only needs about 1040 CPU cycles on average to process in\nsoftware, and a commodity PC with 3 GHz CPU can process more\nthan 2:8 million packets per second.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[470,233,774,251],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[521,77,725,215]}
