Figure 2 illustrates how the approach\nworks. Suppose a node p has three parents, q1, q2\n","blocks. Whenever a node downloads a block, it will\nnotify its children about the new block. As a result,\nnode p knows about the blocks that are available at\neach parent. Node p will then make a scheduling deci-\nsion, and request di\u000Berent blocks to be received from\ndi\u000Berent parents. For simplicity, we have used a \\\frst\n\ft\" scheduling algorithm. For each parent, we request\nthe \frst block that this parent can provide, and that\nis still needed by the requesting node.
