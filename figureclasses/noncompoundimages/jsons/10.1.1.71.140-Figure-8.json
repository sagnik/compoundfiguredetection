{"Caption":"Figure 8: CAMEO GUI illustrating the off-line replay and tracking system.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["CAMEO records each video data stream to an MPEG-4 movie file that can be used for\noff-line processing. CAMEO includes an on-line logging facility by which the tracked\ninformation is broadcast over the network to client for real-time monitoring, recording,\nand analysis. Meeting information can be recorded and used for many different pur-\nposes, including generating meeting summaries, allowing for specific queries about the\nmeeting, and for possibly learning specific dynamic meeting patterns.\nSeveral GUI tools, one of which is shown in Figure 8, have been developed for\nCAMEO which allow a user to augment the captured video stream with information\nsuch as who was attending the meeting, and when they arrived and if they left early. Be-\ncause the current frontal face detection system only operates when people are looking\ndirectly at the camera, some additional processing is done to track people\u2019s positions\nin the image. When CAMEO is told ahead of time how many people are attending the\nmeeting, the correlation problem becomes much more tractable. Additionally, the GUI\nallows a user to label each of the people who attend the meeting if that information is\nnot readily available.\nCAMEO\u2019s tracker system makes several basic assumptions about the dynamics of\npeople in the meeting. One assumption is that during a meeting people typically do\nnot move very fast as they are sitting down for the majority of the meeting duration.\n"],"Page":14,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[224,397,643,411],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[193,172,675,380]}
