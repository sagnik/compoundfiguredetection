In contrast, several\nflows receive much lower throughput under MMAC and 802.11.\nOverall, MMAC outperforms 802.11. However, in 7 out of the 10\nflows it receives substantially lower throughput than AMCP and\nflows 6 and 7 receive very low throughput similar to 802.11. This\ninefficiency is due to the superposition of ATIM window overhead,\nthe random channel selection problem and the HOL problem.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":14,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,331,772,359],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[490,150,717,315]}
