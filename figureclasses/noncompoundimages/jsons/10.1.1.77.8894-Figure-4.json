It en-\ncodes and decodes a frame of speech every 20ms. For a testbench\nthat excercises the design with 163 frames, this translates to a total\ntiming constraint of 3.26 s.\nThe vocoder is a computation-dominated design. Therefore, de-\nsign space exploration is focused on computation design. We esti-\nmated an upper bound for the communication overhead using the\nprofiler by mapping all system communication onto a ColdFire bus.\nLeaving a margin for the estimated communication delay of appr.\n280ms, we derived a timing constraint of appr. 3 s for the vocoder\ncomputation.\nIn the profiling stage, we instrumented, simulated, and profiled\nthe vocoder specification to generate the specification characteris-\ntics. Table 1 shows the computational complexity for the vocoder\u2019s\nfive top-level behaviors in millions of operations (MOp). Note that\nas a typical multimedia application, parallelism in the vocoder is\nlimited and at the top level behaviors execute sequentially in a loop.\nTherefore, there is little promise of exploiting concurrency and de-\nsign should focus on optimizing the critical parts of the behavior\nsequence. As the profiling results show, the Codebook search be-\nhavior is by far the most critical vocoder block. The profiler also\nprovides the mix of operations in the Codebook behavior (Table 2;\na screenshot of the operation mix pie chart and the bar graph of\nthe top-level behaviors as displayed in the design environment GUI\nis shown in Figure 3). The codebook search (and the vocoder in\ngeneral) does not contain any floating-point but only integer-type\noperations, i.e. processors with dedicated floating-point units are\nnot necessary and processor selection should focus on integer per-\nformance instead. Furthermore, most of the operations are multi-\nplications, i.e. selected processors should have dedicated hardware\nmultipliers.\nFor further exploration in the retargeting stage, we allocated a\nsystem architecture with three PEs: in addition to the Motorola\nColdFire CPU running at 60MHz, we selected a DSP (Motorola\nDSP56600 at 60MHz) and a custom hardware processor (100MHz)\nto explore vocoder speedups. Mappings of eight top-level behav-\niors (five top-level vocoder behaviors plus three levels of hierarchy\nof behaviors inside Codebook) to every PE were evaluated. Using\nthe scripting capabilities of the design environment together with\nthe profiler, we ran an exhaustive search of all 38 = 6561 design\nalternatives. Running on a Pentium IV Linux PC at 2.0 GHz, the\ncomplete search was finished in 3:15 h. It contains one time simula-\ntion (2.23 s), one time profiling (8.41 s) and 6561 times retargeting\n(0.8 s for each) and mapping (0.97 s for each) respectively.\nFigure 4 shows computation time vs. cost for all design alter-\nnatives. For both ColdFire and DSP a fixed cost of 20 each was\nassigned for the manufacturing cost. For custom hardware, a linear\ncost function with a base cost of 20 and an additional cost of 1$\n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[520,654,690,667],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,401,771,629]}
