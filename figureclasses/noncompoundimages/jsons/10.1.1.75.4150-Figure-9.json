In the first case study, we selected a network \ncommunication SoC subsystem used for fast data packet processing and \nforwarding. Figure 9 shows the CTG for this system. There are two data \nmanipulation related TCP constraints that must be satisfied in this system. \nThe first TCP involves the encryption engine and includes the ARM926, \nASIC1, RAM3 and EXT_IF blocks. The EXT_IF block fetches data and \nstores it in RAM3. The ASIC1 and ARM926 blocks fetch non overlapping \nsections of the data, process them and store them back in RAM3, from \n","For our second case study, we considered a derivative of the network \ncommunication subsystem from Figure 9, which extends and partially \nmodifies the functionality of the previous system. Figure 12 shows this \nderivative architecture, which has an additional TCP constraint involving \nthe ARM926, SWITCH, RAM2 and two newly added components: a \nmemory array (RAM4) and an ASIC block (ASIC2). In this TCP, data \npackets received from the SWITCH are stored in RAM2. These packets are \nretrieved by ASIC2 which reads and modifies some protocol header \ninformation before storing it back to RAM4 from where the SWITCH must \nstream it out at a minimum data rate of 3.2 Gbps. The ARM926 is used \nminimally, for directing data flow in this TCP.  \n"],"Page":5,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[132,369,354,383],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[97,214,396,368]}
