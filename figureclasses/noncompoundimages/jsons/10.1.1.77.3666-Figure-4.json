The most important features are the head word\nof the phrase (e.g., \u201CTom\u201D or \u201Csalad\u201D above), and the path\nfrom the verb to the phrase being classified; these features\nare illustrated in Figure 4 for our example sentence.\n","For our results we consider a set of features that at-\ntempts to take advantage of structure within the paths from\nthe verb to the phrase. In Figure 4, \u201CTom\u201D has a fairly\ncomplicated path to the verb. In the sentence \u201CTom ate a\nsalad.\u201D the path from \u201CTom\u201D to \u201Ceat\u201D is simpler, NP ←\nS(NP ) → V P → T . However, in both cases the path\ncontains the segment NP ← S(NP ) → V P . This ex-\nample suggests that we take subsequences of the path as\nfeatures in order to generalize between different paths with\ncommon elements. To keep the number of features from\nbecoming too large, we restricted to segments containing\nexactly 3 nodes. Note that previous work (Moschitti, 2004)\nhas used string or tree kernels to find common structure\nbetween paths; our feature set is somewhat similar to the\nimplicit feature set encoded in these kernels. The differ-\nence here is that we will regularize each feature separately,\n"],"Page":6,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[75,276,401,289],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[82,96,403,265]}
