For this task,\nshe also included a SICK laser scanner, a Canon VC-C4 PTZ\ncamera, an LCDmonitor with an animated face, and an ELO\n1224 LCD touch screen. The robot has two computers on\nboard: one for controlling mobility, sensing with the laser,\navoiding obstacles, and handling the touch screen interface,\nand the other for vision, control of the face and voice, and\ngeneral task control. The software architecture follows the\ndesign used in previous years for our entries in the Robot\nChallenge. Independent processes communicate via IPC\nmessage passing (http:\/\/www.cs.cmu.edu\/âˆ¼IPC). No remote\ncommunications were used, except for startup and shut-\ndown.\n"],"Page":1,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[526,551,690,565],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[519,297,699,536]}
