{"Caption":"Figure 6: Behavior of the incoming traffic (strength) sin as a function of the number of server-to-client connections (degree) kin . Top: behavior of the av- erage in-strength sin (kin ) as a function of the in- degree. The behavior is linear on a double logarith- mic scale and is well approximated by power-law behavior with slope Î²in      1.2. Bottom: frequency of clients with given in-strength for each value of the in-degree. In this and the following distribu- tion maps, tones represent frequencies of strength values, normalized within each degree bin, on a log scale.
