The tactors were positioned individually for\neach subject, and held in place by pressure using a\nneoprene belt, forming a TactaBelt. The tactors were\nruggedized versions of the Tokyo Parts Industrial Co., Ltd.,\nModel No. FM37E, and have an operating voltage range of\n2.5-3.8V at 40mA (Figure 2). They have a frequency of\n142Hz at 3.0V, and have a vibration quantity of 0.85G. The\nstimulus frequency for our experiments, determined from\nprevious work [11, 12], was set to 130Hz.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[531,980,684,996],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,725,780,969]}
