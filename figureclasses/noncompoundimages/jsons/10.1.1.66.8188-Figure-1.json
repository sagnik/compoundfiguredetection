{"Caption":"Figure 1: A typical on-screen keyboard on an HP iPAQ PDA.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["This paper presents a study into the use of tactile feedback \nfor an on-screen PDA keyboard where a stylus (or finger) is \nused to press the keys. Entering text on such keyboards is \nproblematic as the keys are small (less than 1cm\n2\n on a PDA \nsuch as in Figure 1). Trying to do this whilst mobile makes \ninteraction even harder as the PDA and stylus are both \nmoving. Particularly difficult situations are on buses or \ntrains, which can be very bumpy, yet these are situations \nwhere people often want to read\/send email, browse Web \nsites, etc. on their way to work. The aim of our work was to \nlook at the effects of tactile feedback from key presses with \na stylus to see if performance could be improved.  \n","We designed a simple interface to allow users to enter text \nusing an on-screen keyboard on an iPAQ (copying the dis-\nplay seen in Figure 1). We gave participants short messages \nto type in and logged the kinds of errors and slips made. We \nencouraged them to be as fast and accurate as possible. \nThere were six participants, all male students from the Uni-\nversity (aged 19-26) and familiar with mobile devices. The \nstudy took around 10 minutes per person. \n"],"Page":1,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[442,457,771,470],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[556,294,666,447]}
