observation session was roughly 90 minutes \nand, to minimize invasiveness, used only one observer. \nAt the beginning of each observation session, to \nencourage the participant to narrate his work, we asked \nthe participant to think of us as a newcomer to the \nteam, doing a \u201Cjob shadow.\u201D We focused on recording \ngoal-oriented events like \u201Cfinding the method that \ncomputed the wrong value\u201D rather than lower level \nevents like keystrokes or menu selections. Since we \nshared the participants programming background, we \ncould understand much of the work and where and \nhow information was obtained, without inquiry. In \nsome cases, we prompted with questions like \u201Cwhat are \nyou looking for?\u201D to learn their information needs, but \nmost developers thought aloud without prompting. We \ntimestamped the recorded events and conversations \neach minute. After 90 minutes, we looked for a good \nstopping point and wrapped up. Immediately after each \nobservation, we transcribed the handwritten notes, as \nin the excerpt shown in Figure 1. \nAfter meeting with 17 developers, both observers \nfelt they had seen enough redundancy that additional \nsessions were unnecessary. Details about the \ndevelopers we observed are shown in the left of Figure \n2, which introduces initials that will be used to refer \nanonymously to specific developers throughout this \npaper. Dev leads manage SDEs (software development \nengineers) while also performing a development role. \nOur sample is random in several respects, including \nexperience, phase, and customer (including projects \nwith no dependent teams, projects on which many \nteams depended, and several in between). \n","Three developers used static analysis tools to check for \nfault prone design patterns {JKU}, but expressed \ndisdain for such tools\u2019 false positives or could not \nunderstand the tools\u2019 recommendations. \nDevelopers also considered their team\u2019s \nconventions (s2). Some teams required tags or other \ndocumentation to be embedded in method headers and \ndevelopers were careful to remember to insert these, \noften with the help of tools {BELN}. Sometimes two \nsubmissions intersected (Figure 1) or developers had to \nmerge their code with another\u2019s and developers had to \ndetermine which differences were part of the current \nsubmission (s3) {JN}. This was a manual process, in \nwhich developers tried to remember which change task \nthey belonged to. \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[441,971,688,985],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,863,745,966]}
