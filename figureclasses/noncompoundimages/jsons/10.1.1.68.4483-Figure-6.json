{"Caption":"Figure 6: Toy house. Top left: reference image and mesh. Top right: matching image and matching mesh based on sparse LP method. Middle: dense x motion (left). dense y motion (right). Bottom: regular mesh matching based on dense motion ﬁeld. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["y directions. The basis sets for each site are selected based\non the scheme proposed in § 3.1. We calculate the dense\nmotion ﬁeld in Fig. 4 based on the proposed two-phase\nscheme. To visualize the dense motion estimation result,\nwe plot the matching result on regular grids based on the\ndense motion estimation, in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the dense\nmotion estimation result based on the graph-cut scheme in\n[12]. In this experiment, the graph-cut method uses 3 itera-\ntions and takes about 15 minutes to ﬁnish with a Pentium-4\n2.6GHz Linux PC. The proposed two-stage scheme takes\nabout 5 minutes. More experimental results, using image\nToy house, are shown in Fig. 6.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,420,768,494],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[471,98,739,405]}
