For com-\nparison, we created synthetic 5d and 10d systems each\ncontaining 250 random points in a unit hypercube and\nfound their singular values. As one would expect, the syn-\nthetic 5d and 10d data sets show a sharp knee soon after 5\nand 10 singular values, respectively. In contrast, the bulk\nof the inter-node latency information from two Internet-\nbased data sets requires very few dimensions. Azureus, in\nparticular, is dominated by a single dimension, and MIT\nKing by two. However, the next several dimensions re-\nmain significant for the few nodes that need to navigate\naround the clusters of nodes that have found good posi-\ntions. In the data, this is shown by the continued rele-\nvance of singular values when compared to synthetic data\nsets. To lower the error for these nodes, we find 4 âˆ’ 5\n","We ran an experiment where we compared ICMP, fil-\ntered, and raw latency measurements that were taken at\nthe same time. To determine which destination nodes to\nuse, we started Azureus on three PlanetLab nodes and\nchose five ping-able neighbors after a twenty-minute start-\nup period. We then let Azureus continue to run normally\nfor six hours while simultaneously measuring the latency\nto these nodes with ping. We plot the data in Figure 14.\nFigure 14 (a) illustrates a pair similar to our PlanetLab\nobservations: there was raw application-level and ICMP\nvariance, but a consistent baseline that could be described\nwith a single value. In contrast, Figure 14 (b) portrays a\nhigh variance pair: while the filter does approximate the\nmedian round trip time, it is difficult to say, at any point in\ntime, what the latency is between this pair.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[443,249,765,313],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[462,96,737,248]}
