{"Caption":"Figure 3: Experimental comparison of the ranking SVM, IVM and the proposed method on nine benchmark datasets. Along with the mean values in 10 fold cross-validation, the entire range of vari- ation is indicated in the error-bars. (a) The overall accuracy for all the three methods is comparable. (b) The proposed method has a much lower run time than the other methods, even for the full graph case for medium to large size datasets. NOTE: Both SVM-light and IVM ran out of memory and crashed on dataset 4; on dataset 1, SVM-light failed to complete even one fold after more than 24 hours of run time, so its results could not be compiled in time for submission.
