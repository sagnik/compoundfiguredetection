In the remainder of our work, we build\nour dynamic power management framework upon this phase\nprediction methodology. However, for a real-system imple-\nmentation, holding and and associatively searching through a\n1024 entry PHT may be undesirable. Therefore, in Figure 5,\nwe show how GPHT prediction accuracy changes with dif-\nferent number of PHT entries. As the figure shows, down to\n128 entries, GPHT predictor performs almost identically to\nthe 1024 entry predictor. However, observable degradations\nin accuracy are seen with a 64 entry PHT. As PHT entries are\nreduced down to 1, the accuracy of the GPHT predictor con-\n","interrupt (PMI) handler. We use our runtime phase predictions\nto guide dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), read-\nily available on our Pentium-M platform, as the example man-\nagement application. At each interrupt invocation, after per-\nforming the next phase prediction with the GPHT predictor,\nthe interrupt routine translates the predicted phase into a pre-\ndefined DVFS setting. This setting is then applied to the pro-\ncessor for the next execution interval. Figure 8 shows a simpli-\nfied overview of how this overall implementation operates on\nour system. After the initial configuration (performed once at\nsystem startup) all phase prediction and dynamic management\nactions operate autonomously, with no observable overheads\nto user applications. All applications can run natively, without\nany modifications or additional system or dynamic compiler\nsupport.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[454,566,765,611],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,331,783,560]}
