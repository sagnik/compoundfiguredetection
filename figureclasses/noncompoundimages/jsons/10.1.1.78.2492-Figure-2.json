A stateful public-key encryption scheme StPE = (Setup,KG,PKCk,\nNwSt,Enc,Dec) is specified by six algorithms (all possibly randomized except the last) whose op-\neration is illustrated in Figure 2. The setup algorithm Setup is run by an authority to produce\nsystem parameters sp. Any entity that wants to receive encrypted data can run the key-generation\nalgorithm KG on input sp to get a public and secret key for itself. A sender maintains state st\nwhose initial value is obtained by running the new state algorithm NwSt on input sp. At any time,\nthe sender can apply the encryption algorithm to sp, a public key pk , message M and its current\nstate st to get two outputs. The first, C , is a ciphertext for the receiver whose public key is pk , and\nthe second is an updated value for the state variable for the sender.
