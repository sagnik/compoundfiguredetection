As they\nleave their eBags disappear from the display.\nThe pupils are equipped with mobile phones capable of\ntaking pictures as well as making audio and video recordings.\nThey visit different parts of the city, interviewing museum\ncustodians and local business vendors and taking pictures\nof streets and building as they look today. As interviews\nand recordings are made these are saved directly from the\nphone into the eBag.
