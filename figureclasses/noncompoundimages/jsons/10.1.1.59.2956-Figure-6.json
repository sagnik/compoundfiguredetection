The difference in precision and recall is given by the fact\nthat in RW VC we ensured that the query will not visit the same peer again unless absolutely necessary (there is\nno other neighbor to visit). The small irregularities in the graphs are given by the random jumps which sometimes\nlead to \u201Dpoor\u201D peers.\nWe continued in the same manner, testing a neighbor-based and a PageRank-based search (figures 5 and 6).\nAs predicted, the latter approach performs slightly better. Although selecting the neighbor with the largest number\nof neighbors finds best peers relatively fast, it usually cannot find them faster then when the actual best neighbor\nis selected.\nWe also tested these last two experiments without random jumps. We found both better precision and better\n"],"Page":9,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[250,354,598,368],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[267,94,579,315]}
