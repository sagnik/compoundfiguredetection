{"Caption":"Figure 1. Relative RMSE improvement over a ridge regression baseline of the meta-level prior model with a training set of 100 examples from each movie. Each point is a movie task m. The x- axis is the range of the learned feature relevances for each movie: maxm\u2032 β ⊤ f m,m\u2032 − minm\u2032 β ⊤ f m,m\u2032 . The results are averaged over 5 random splits of training and test sets.
