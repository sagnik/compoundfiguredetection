The Stanford dataset has a maximum of under\n9,000 new flow-requests per second (Figure 8).\nPerhaps surprisingly, our results suggest that a single Controller\ncould comfortably manage a network with over 20,000 hosts. In-\ndeed flow setup latencies for continued load of up to 6,000\/s are\nless than .6ms, equivalent to the average latency of a DNS request\nwithin the Stanford network. Flow setup latencies for load under\n2,000 requests per second are .4ms, this is roughly equivalent to\nthe average RTT between hosts in different subnets on our campus\nnetwork.\nOf course, in practice, the rule set would be larger and the num-\nber of physical entities greater. On the other hand, the ease with\nwhich the Controller handles this number of flows suggests there\nis room for improvement. This is not to suggest that a network\nshould rely on a single Controller; we expect a large network to\ndeploy several Controllers for fault-tolerance, using the schemes\noutlined in ยง3.5, one of which we examine next.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[471,376,738,389],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[469,243,728,376]}
