{"Caption":"Figure 10: Head model for the enhanced CAMEO tracking system.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["In future work, CAMEO will be augmented to handle the case where the frontal face\ndetector doesn\u2019t detect faces. In this case a simple model of an elliptical shape template\ncombined with a human skin color model, shown in Figure 10, along with a motion\nblob detector (based on background differencing) will be used to detect the appearance\nof a person in the scene. This model will be used to generate a richer set of perceptual\nfeatures that CAMEO will use to attempt to recognize and classify people\u2019s behaviors.\nThe head model consists of an elliptical template representing the top portion of the\nhead (with the semi-major axis being b and semi-minor axis being a) combined with\na horizontal line representing the shoulder (h being the vertical offset from the center\nof the ellipse and 2l being the width of the shoulder). Once a person\u2019s head is detected\nthe body position will be estimated by the motion blob based on a simple face-body\nmodel.\n"],"Page":16,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[246,870,620,884],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[308,630,562,850]}
