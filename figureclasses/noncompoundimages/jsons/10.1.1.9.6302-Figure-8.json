{"Caption":"Figure 8: Segmentation results of frame 1 in the mobile-calendar sequence. Top: The segmentation results obtained by using only two frames. Bottom: The multi-frame segmentation results obtained by using five frames (1-5). (a − d) Segmentation results between frames 1 and 2-5 respectively. The red pixels in segmented images are the occluded pixels.
