{"Caption":"Figure 6. Results for more test images with increasing complexity. From left to right are original image with selected bounding boxes, result using GrabCut, result using KDE-EM, and segmentation and pose estimation results using our proposed method. Note that in these examples, we assume there is single foreground object and only segment the human in the center of the image. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We have tested our approach to single-human segmen-\ntation on the INRIA person dataset [1]. Figure 5 shows\ncomparison of the segmentation performances for Grab-\nCut, KDE-EM, CDMRF-KDE-EM, and the proposed ap-\nproach. KDE-EM resulted in a very inaccurate segmen-\ntation with many holes and isolated small regions. Grab-\nCut obtained coherent segmentations but the results are\nvery sensitive to the interactive initialization and does not\nguarantee a human-like segmentation. CDMRF-KDE-EM\nobtained a coherent segmentation but incorrectly included\nbackground regions in the segmentation. In contrast, with\nthe local MRF and global shape priors provided by the PS\npose model inference, our approach achieved the best result,\nand the segmentation accuracy almost reached the ground\ntruth (98.71%) for this example. Results for more difficult\nexamples are shown in Figure 6.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[437,367,767,456],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[473,99,736,349]}
