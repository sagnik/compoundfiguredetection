Thus,\nwe observe that CAS significantly reduces the volume of\ndata transmitted during upload operations, and hence the\nwait time experienced at the end of a user session.\n","CAS outperforms compression. Figure 11(a) indi-\ncates that the ALL policy without compression outper-\nforms the Delta policy with compression for chunk sizes\nless than 64 KB (as does the IP policy at a 4 KB chunk\nsize). This shows that for our application, inter-chunk\nCAS techniques may identify and eliminate more re-\ndundancy than traditional intra-chunk compression tech-\nniques. The difference may be substantial, particularly\nwhen the upload size is large.

Figure 11(a)\nshows very clearly that smaller chunksizes result in more\nefficient upload transmission for CAS policies.

In all of Fig-\nure 10, the common observation between an IP and ALL\ncomparison is that the ALL policy consistently outper-\nforms the IP policy. This observation is consistent with\nour intuition that for upload operations, the ALL policy\nmust perform at least as well as the IP policy because\nthe ALL policy identifies redundancy within the set of\nblocks visible to the IP policy as well as blocks in other\nparcels. In fact, Figure 11(a) indicates that the ALL pol-\nicy performs about twice as well as the IP policy for\nsmall chunk sizes and approximately 25 percent better\nat larger chunk sizes.\n","Chunk sizes of 4 KB turned out to be optimal for all\npolicies when considering the average upload size.
