We compare the performance of MTAC \nagainst TDAC (we don\u2019t consider MBAC in this case because \nit cannot take advantage of other traffic descriptors apart from \nthe peak rate) for all three different types of traffic sources and \nthe simulation results are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, where M, R, \nW in brackets mean that the relevant curve corresponds to \nmild, reference and worse (non-conformant) sources. \n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[498,500,701,514],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[431,321,782,487]}
