Purely intensity-based segmentation. Contour evolution generated by\nminimizing the Chan-Vese model (2) [3]. The central figure is partially corrupted.\n","The evolution in Figure 1 demonstrates the well-known fact that the level set\nbased segmentation process can cope with multiple objects in a given scene. How-\never, if the low-level segmentation criterion is violated due to noise, background\nclutter or partial occlusion of the objects of interest, then the purely image-based\nsegmentation scheme will fail to converge to the desired segmentation.\nTo cope with such degraded low-level information, it was proposed to intro-\nduce prior shape knowledge into the level set scheme (cf. [9, 17, 15]). The basic\nidea is to extend the image-based cost functional by a shape energy which favors\ncertain contour formations:\n"],"Page":4,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[206,515,668,529],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[274,471,668,510]}
