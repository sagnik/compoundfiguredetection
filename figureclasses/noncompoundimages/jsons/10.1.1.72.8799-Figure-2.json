{"Caption":"Figure 2: The absolute depth feature vector for a patch, which includes features from its immediate neighbors and its more distant neighbors (at larger scales). The relative depth features for each patch use histograms of the filter outputs. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["To estimate the absolute depth at a patch, local image features centered on the patch are\ninsufficient, and one has to use more global properties of the image. We attempt to capture\nthis information by using image features extracted at multiple scales (image resolutions).\n(See Fig. 2.) Objects at different depths exhibit very different behaviors at different resolu-\ntions, and using multiscale features allows us to capture these variations [16].3 In addition\nto capturing more global information, computing features at multiple spatial scales also\nhelp accounts for different relative sizes of objects. A closer object appears larger in the\nimage, and hence will be captured in the larger scale features. The same object when far\naway will be small and hence be captured in the small scale features. Such features may be\nstrong indicators of depth.\n","at a patch includes features of its immediate neighbors, and its far neighbors (at a larger\nscale), and its very far neighbors (at the largest scale), as shown in Fig. 2. Lastly, many\nstructures (such as trees and buildings) found in outdoor scenes show vertical structure, in\nthe sense that they are vertically connected to themselves (things cannot hang in empty air).\nThus, we also add to the features of a patch additional summary features of the column it\nlies in.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,475,675,520],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[200,201,649,466]}
