We evaluate the performance of AMCP\nunder non-backlogged conditions. Fig. 9 depicts the aggregate\nthroughput of AMCP and IEEE 802.11 in a 15-flow topology as\nthe input rate of each flow increases, when a total of 4 channels are\nused. Until 10 packets\/s, the load is too low to exploit the additional\ndata channels and AMCP yields similar performance to 802.11. Af-\nter that point, channelization becomes effective and AMCP reaches\nan aggregate throughput gain equal to the number of data channels.\nWe note that existing multi-channel MAC protocols can achieve\nsimilar or slightly higher aggregate throughput than AMCP. For\nexample, for 4 channels and under heavy load, DCA [33] also\nachieves three times the aggregate throughput of 802.11, similar to\nAMCP. This is because both AMCP and DCA dedicate a separate\nchannel for control traffic. On the other hand, MMAC transmits\ncontrol and data packets over 4 channels and achieves an additional\ngain of 20%-30%. However, DCA requires two radio transceivers\nper node and MMAC requires global synchronization. AMCP uses\na single transceiver and no global synchronization.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[85,873,391,886],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[126,702,355,857]}
