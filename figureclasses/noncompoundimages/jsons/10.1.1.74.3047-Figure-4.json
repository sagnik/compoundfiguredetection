{"Caption":"Figure 4: Blocks world with stack goal","ImageText":[],"Mention":["First, we test the quality of the transition function. To\nachieve this, we apply the learned model as a classiﬁer. We\nrandomly generate facts and predict if they will be true in the\nresulting next state, given some state and action. Figure 2\nshows the percentage of errors made per step, False Positives\n(FP) and False Negatives (FN) indicate the number of atoms\nthat were incorrectly predicted as true and false respectively.\nFor the blocks world with seven blocks the transition func-\ntion is learned rather rapidly and is optimal after about 200\nepisodes. For the logistics domain with ﬁve boxes, trucks\nand cities, it appears that a reasonable transition function is\nlearned rapidly, but it never reaches optimal performance.\nNext, we evaluate the improvement obtained by lookahead\nplanning. Therefore, we ran both experiments with standard\nRRL-TG and experiments with different amounts of looka-\nhead using the learned model. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the\nresults for the on(a, b) and stack goals of the blocks world\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[494,674,716,691],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[445,408,764,667]}
