Figure 10\nshows the attacker's new algorithm. When the victim\nmakes a system call, it is forced to sleep on I\/O while re-\nsolving the \u0002lename. The attacker then wakes up, deter-\nmines the victim's current system call, switches target\nso the victim's system call will succeed, and advances\nactivemaze to point to the next maze.
