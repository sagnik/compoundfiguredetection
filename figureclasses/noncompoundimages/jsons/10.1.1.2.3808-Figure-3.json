If a node moves\nout of its space region, it becomes semantically unaccept-\nable. Thus, the application receives a timeout exception\n(the system could not find the node during the timeout in-\nterval). However, if the programmer still wants to access\nthis node and has knowledge about the node\u2019s mobility pat-\nterns, the space region for the spatial reference mapped to\nthis node can be modified using space casting. The con-\nstruct {space2:(space1:tag[index])} changes the geograph-\nical scope of the spatial reference from space1 to space2.\nFig. 3 shows how space casting is used to reach a camera\ncarried by a mobile robot which has moved from Hill1 to\nHill2. If the new space for a node is unknown, a program-\nmer can use the Anywhere space constant to cast a spatial\nreference to any space. Note that in such a case the time-\nout ensures that the attempted access will not take forever.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,274,769,305],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[438,102,785,249]}
