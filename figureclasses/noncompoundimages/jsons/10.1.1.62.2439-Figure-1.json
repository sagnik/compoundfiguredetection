{"Caption":"Figure 1: Example of diagram-based reasoning in teams. The task is to visualize a set of topological relations given in the RCC-8 calculus (Randell et al, 1992): {NTPP(A,B), PO(A,C), DC(B,D)}. One of the possible models is jointly constructed on the common external representation in the center. (NTTP = non-tangential proper part; PO = partial overlap; DC = disconnected).
