In \nCatledge and Pitkow\u2019s data [6], its use amounts to 36% of \nall navigation actions. Tauscher and Greenberg still found a \n32% share of \u2018back\u2019 events [33]. Looking at the navigation \nactions of all users in this study (Figure 1), the back button \nrate decreased to 14.3% of all navigation actions. Although \nthe large discrepancy to preceding studies may seem surpri-\nsing, recent smaller studies [25,14] did also report a lower \nshare of back button use. Submission of forms has become \nmuch more important (15%), as has opening pages in a new \nwindow or tab (11%). Following hyperlinks remained to be \nthe most frequent activity with 44% of all user actions. \nChoosing a bookmark, typing a URI in the address bar and \nthe homepage button (subsumed as \u2018Direct Access\u2019, 9%) \nwere used somewhat less than in earlier studies (Table 1).  \n"],"Page":4,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[74,308,324,323],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[100,90,363,304]}
