As shown in Figure 1, Tracefs [2] is a stackable\n\u0002le system [40]. Tracefs passes through all the Virtual\nFile System (VFS) requests down to the lower \u0002le system\n(or a tree of several mounted \u0002le systems). Before invok-\ning the lower operations and after returning from them,\nTracefs logs the input and output values and the timing\ninformation associated with the requests. Replayfs is log-\nically located at the same level as Tracefs\u0097right above\nthe lower \u0002le system as shown in Figure 2. However, Re-\nplayfs is not a stackable \u0002le system; it is not a \u0002le system\neither. It reproduces the behavior of the VFS during the\ntrace capture time and appears like a VFS for the lower\n\u0002le system. Replayfs operates similarly to the part of the\nVFS which directly interacts with lower \u0002le systems.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[435,271,751,307],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[475,98,714,263]}
