{"Caption":"Figure 4. Privacy Bird indication of a conformance conflict.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["P3P user agents are the mechanisms for this automation. They \nread the privacy policies implemented by a website and show the \nconformance of the vendor\u2019s privacy policy with the user\u2019s \nprivacy preferences. Current P3P user agents (e.g., ATT Privacy \nBird [3]) present a visual indication of site conformance in the \nbrowser\u2019s title bar and give a more detailed conformance report in \na separate window (see Figures 4 & 5).  \n","The AT&T Privacy Bird implements the complete P3P and \nAPPEL specification [19]. The system displays a bird icon in the \nbrowser\u2019s title bar that changes color (and can also make sounds) \nto indicate whether or not a website\u2019s P3P policy matches a user\u2019s \nprivacy preferences (Figure 4). The icon is also used to access the \nprivacy policy information and the conformance information. \nThis additional text is presented in a separate window (Figure 5). \n","We showed participants several alternate designs for the \nconformance display, looking at different ways of placing icons \nand grouping fields (e.g., Figure 14). The current IPV agent puts \nan icon next to every input field to indicate conformance. We \nwere interested in whether participants would see this as adding \nclutter to the page, whether they would have difficulty with icons \nthat were below the page fold, and how they would interpret the \nlack of conformance icons on fields and pages. \n"],"Page":3,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,161,742,178],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,73,776,160]}
