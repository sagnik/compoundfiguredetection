Figure 9 plots\nthe coefficient of variance (defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean) of TTR and TTF in PL trace.\nMost nodes have a coefficient greater than 1.0 which implies quite a wide probability distribution. Similar\nresults hold for WS trace as shown in Figure 10. Again, we do not analyze DNS trace for previously\nmentioned reasons.\nGiven that TTR and TTF cannot be accurately predicted, we turn to the predictability of MTTF and\nMTTR. We split the traces into two parts and for each node compare the MTTR and MTTF observed in\none part with the other. Figure 11 plots the percentage difference in MTTR and MTTF between the first 8\nmonths and the remaining 9 months of PL trace. Clearly, the MTTR and MTTF for most nodes do not vary\nsignificantly over the two periods. We observe similar results for other splits of the PL trace (Figure 13)\nWe also observe similar results for WS trace (Figure 12). We do not perform this study for DNS trace\nbecause of its short duration.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,512,750,528],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[277,335,571,501]}
