","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Based on the detected eyes and certain anthropometric\nstatistics, a front-parallel face can be detected automatically.\nThe detected face region will serve as the initial 3D pla-\nnar face model. The 3D face pose is then tracked in 3D\nspace using Kalman filter, starting from the front-parallel\nface pose. During the process of tracking, face detection\nand face pose estimation are synchronized such that the de-\ntected face and the estimated face pose are kept consistent\nwith each other. In addition, the 3D face model is updated\ncontinuously in order to accommodate face change due to\nvariations in illumination, face aspect, and facial expres-\nsion. The detected face normal vector is perpendicular to\nthe face plane, which is represented by three angles of ori-\nentation \u0001dcfe\nK)ghg\n\u00170ibj\n:&kdlnm\n\u0017)oqpsrutv\u0006 (detailed description can be\nfound in [14]).
