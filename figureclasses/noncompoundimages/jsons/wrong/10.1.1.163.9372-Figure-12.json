{"Caption":"Figure 12: Effect of WLOP on RBF surface reconstruction. Raw scan (a) of an Inukshuk is cleaned by the original LOP (b) with the point regularity measure taking on value σ = 0.2953 and our WLOP (d) with σ = 0.0987. Observe the uniformity of the re- sulting particle distributions. After normal consolidation and up- sampling, RBF constructions, (c) from (b) and (e) from (d), show qualitative difference in hole filling, e.g., around the neck. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["First, we show the effect of WLOP in Figure 12. The input is a\nraw scan with missing data. After WLOP, up-sampling and robust\nnormal consolidation, RBF is able to successfully close holes and\nconstruct a quality surface. In contrast, with the original LOP oper-\nator, although noise and outliers are removed as well, the resulting\nirregular particle distribution (quantified by σ) may cause some de-\nfects on hole closure during surface generation.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,442,775,538],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[440,333,777,427]}
