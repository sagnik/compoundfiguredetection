4. We then identify the main limitations of these features\nand introduce a new additional feature to provide more resolution.\nWe have tested a number of approaches including k-NN, LDA,\nand QDA, on a number of different features (listed above), but the\napproaches found to be most illustrative of the possibilities here\nwere k-NN, and LDA with quadratic variables, applied to the flow\nduration and average packets size. LDA with quadratic variables,\nthough similar to QDA, seemed to produce slightly better results\ngiven the small amounts of data available to estimate within class\ncovariances. Figures 1 (a) and (b) show scatter plots of data from\nseven separate one day long WAND traces. The plots show aver-\nage packet size versus average flow duration for four applications:\nTelnet, DNS, FTP-data, and Streaming video, the first three from\nWAND, and the last from the streaming application logs, because\nthere is very little streaming traffic within the WAND data. In Fig-\nure 1 (a) we also show LDA boundaries (solid lines) when the traffic\nis broken into four classes, while in Figure 1 (b) 1-NN boundaries\nare shown.\nFigure 2 presents similar plots from the first data set collected by\nthe Gigascope (each data-point represents averages over one day\u2019s\ndata). In this case the connection records used in the plots show the\naverage TCP connection duration, rather than the flow lengths. As\nnoted above, the durations in this data can be significantly larger\nthan those seen in Figure 1. In these plots, we use six applications\nfor training the classification (dns, ftp-data, https, kazaa, realme-\ndia, and telnet). We can do so in this data set (as compared with the\nprevious data) because we can use Gigascope\u2019s advanced features\nto make an accurate classification of applications such as Kazaa.\nWWW traffic is not used in training the classification, but is in-\ncluded in the plot because the results are interesting. WWW traffic\nfalls between the bulk-data and transactional classes \u2014 exactly as\none might suspect. It also has some occasional departures into the\nstreaming class \u2014 also a possibility for web traffic. Finally, Fig-\nure 3 shows similar plots to Figure 2, but for a seven-class breakup.\nWhile the above plots suggest that the boundaries obtained are\nreasonable, they do not provide a quantitative measure of the qual-\nity of the classification. We next obtain such a measure using cross-\nvalidation [19]. To perform cross-validation we randomly divide\nthe data into 10 blocks, and for each block use the other 9 blocks\nas training data, and then validate the classification on the block in\nquestion. We validate by comparing the true class of a measurement\nwith that determined by the various algorithms above and report the\nresults in Table 3. The table shows (in the 4 class column) that the\nerrors are only 5.1% for the best method, 3-NN.\nInterestingly in this data, analysis of the within-class variance of\nthe measurements show that the variation decreases significantly as\nthe number of connections increases. This is what one would expect\nif the measurements are statistically uncorrelated, and suggests that\none could improve the accuracy of the results by simply increasing\nthe sample sizes. Research is needed into how large a sample one\nrequires for training and classification.\nAlthough, we do not propose specific application classification\nas a general technique (it is not needed for QoS), it may be valuable\nin places, and so we also perform cross-validation for the problem\nof classifying applications. For the data in question, this leads to\nseven classes (domain, ftp-data, https, kazaa, realmedia, telnet, or\nwww). One can also see from Table 3 that the errors are still not\nlarge, < 10%, and once again 3-NN is the best method of those\n"],"Page":9,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[267,842,579,855],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[74,570,773,817]}
