We order the pro\u0002les based on the ranks of all\nmulti-port pro\u0002les collected at the UW I network, which showed\nthe greatest af\u0002nity to Agobot. The table reveals several notable\nobservations. First, the top two exploits are extensively observed\nacross all four networks and their rankings are consistent in the\nClass B networks \u0097 a spatial invariant. Second, although the LBL\nnetwork is much smaller, it observes the same number of sources\nas the other two UW networks for the top three exploits. This is\nprobably due to the fact that the networks belong to the same \/8,\nand suggests that these multi-port sources often sweep the address\nspace. Third, UW I receives many more Agobot scans than the\nother networks, though we don\u2019t know why.\nWe explore Agobot scans in greater detail in Figure 12. The \u0002g-\nures show the volume of unique sources per hour on several of the\nAgobot ports during a \u0002ve day period in March at the two adja-\ncent UW networks. The graph at UW I shows four visible spikes,\nindicating an Agobot attack. While UW II background radiation\nseems to otherwise closely follow UW I, these Agobot spikes are\npeculiarly absent. These graphs also provide a temporal perspective\non the growth of Agobot, with a striking daily spike-followed-by-\ndecay pattern, presumably as new machines are cleaned up over the\ncourse of the day.\nWe see little Agobot on the Class A network. This likely re\u0003ects\nAgobot\u2019s \u0093maturity\u0094 as malwares go. It has gone through itera-\ntive enhancements and likely has (essentially) \u0093evolved\u0094 to have\nbeen programmed to avoid telescopes; or perhaps it has become\nequipped with list of target networks, or the scanning is being con-\nsciously focused by a human operator via IRC control channels.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[130,323,715,341],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[74,85,771,302]}
