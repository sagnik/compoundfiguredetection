{"Caption":"Figure 6: Some common scenarios where rain produces strong effects and our results on rain reduction\/removal. The frames in column (A) show the scene captured with default camera parameters (camera parameters set automatically by the camera for a given scene). The frames in column (B) show the same scene (with identical environmental conditions) taken with camera parameters estimated by our method to reduce rain visibility. (I)(a) A traffic scene in rain. The scene has fast motion and low depth variation. Our analysis shows that rain can be reduced in this scene by decreasing the F-number to N = 2.4 as shown in I(b). (II) (a) Frame from a video of people walking on a sidewalk. The scene has a large depth range and slow moving objects. For this scene the visibility of rain can be reduced by increasing the exposure time to T = 66 ms as shown in II(b). (III)(a) An image from a video of people walking on stairs. The scene has moderate depth range and motion. Our analysis shows that to reduce rain in this scene without modifying scene appearance, both the exposure time and F-number need to be changed to T = 33ms and N = 6, respectively.(IV) (a) A frame from a video of a scene with heavy rain. Even in this extreme case of very heavy rain, we can reduce rain visibility significantly by increasing the exposure time to T = 120 ms as shown in IV(b). Note that in all these cases the effects of rain were reduced during image acquisition and no post-processing was needed. Also, the visual effects of rain were reduced without affecting the scene appearance. Please see videos at www.cs.columbia.edu\/CAVE.
