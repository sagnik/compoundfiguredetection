Fig. 6 displays the results of a player run-\nning across a line. This example shows that even the back-\nground contains strong edges, the tracker can still accurately\ntrack the player due to the robustness of the PCA-HOG de-\nscriptor. Fig. 7 presents the results of a player running with\na ball and constantly changing actions. The action recogni-\ntion results show that using shape (HOG\/SIFT representa-\ntion) alone also works for the soccer sequence even though\nthe tracking region is small and of low resolution.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[84,464,740,512],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[117,113,710,448]}
