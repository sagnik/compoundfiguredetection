{"Caption":"Figure 10: Disparity (top) and discontinuity   (bottom) maps, obtained by program 6. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["A disparity map codifies the distance between  \nthe object and the camera(s): closer points will have \nmaximal disparity and farther points will get zero \ndisparity. For short, a disparity map gives some \nperception of discontinuity in terms of depth. \nOnly programs 3 and 6 perform this operation, \nwith the difference that program 6 also returns a \ndiscontinuity map. \nThis step was tested with already rectified \nimages included in the package of the program 6 \n(Figure 8). The results obtained are presented in \nFigure 9 and Figure 10. Given two rectified images, \nit is possible to observe that both program 3 and 6 \nperform very well on the determination of the \ndisparity map. \n"],"Page":5,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[466,842,686,873],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[476,525,678,837]}
