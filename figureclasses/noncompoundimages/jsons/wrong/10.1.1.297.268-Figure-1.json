The\ngraph in Figure 1b is the SCC graph of the one in\n","transitive reduction of its SCC graph. The graph in\nFigure 1c is the reduced graph of the one in Fig-\nure 1a and is a directed forest. We say a graph is a\nforest-reducible graph (FRG) if all nodes in its re-\nduced form have no more than one parent.\nWe now hypothesize that entailment graphs are\nFRGs. The intuition behind this assumption is\nthat the predicate on the left-hand-side of a uni-\ndirectional entailment rule has a more specific mean-\ning than the one on the right-hand-side. For instance,\nin Figure 1a \u2018X be epidemic in Y\u2019 (where \u2018X\u2019 is a type\nof disease and \u2018Y\u2019 is a country) is more specific than\n\u2018X common in Y\u2019 and \u2018X frequent in Y\u2019, which are\nequivalent, while \u2018X occur in Y\u2019 is even more gen-\neral. Accordingly, the reduced graph in Figure 1c\nis an FRG. We note that this is not always the case:\nfor example, the entailment graph in Figure 2 is not\nan FRG, because \u2018X annex Y\u2019 entails both \u2018Y be part\nof X\u2019 and \u2018X invade Y\u2019, while the latter two do not\nentail one another. However, we hypothesize that\nthis scenario is rather uncommon. Consequently, a\nnatural variant of the Max-Trans-Graph problem is\nto restrict the required output graph of the optimiza-\ntion problem (1) to an FRG. We term this problem\nMax-Trans-Forest.\nTo test whether our hypothesis holds empirically\nwe performed the following analysis. We sampled\n7 gold standard entailment graphs from the data set\n"],"Page":3,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[433,570,750,634],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[432,101,762,552]}
