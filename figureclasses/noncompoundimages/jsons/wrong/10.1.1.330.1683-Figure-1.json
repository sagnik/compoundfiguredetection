{"Caption":"Figure 1. a) Parallel sequences of speech and actions are recorded from subjects as the expert guides the novice through a virtual environment. b) An intentional tree is inferred over the novice\u2019s sequence of observed actions using a probabilistic context free grammar of behaviors. Each node in the tree is a different level of intentional action and is encoded by a semantic frame. c) The vertical path from a leaf node in the tree (i.e. observed action) to the root (i.e. highest order intentional action) contains multiple possible levels of intention to which an utterance may refer. Linguistic mapping uses d) Expectation Maximization to estimate the conditional probabilities of words given roles to resolve this ambiguity.
