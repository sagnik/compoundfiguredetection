"Caption": "Figure 7: Overlap region approximation in search pruning. (a) Current Ψi (x), formed by an earlier merge of two partial NDFs. (b) Overlap region Ω (enclosed by red line) of Ψi (x) and a candidate (orange). (c) The overlap region can be approximated by the intersection of Ω with a rotated version of itself. (d) A range of rotations, ϕi , are uniformly sampled to get a discrete set of overlap regions used for search pruning. ",
