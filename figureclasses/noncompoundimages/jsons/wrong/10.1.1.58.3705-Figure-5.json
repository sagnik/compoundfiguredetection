Whereas HP and SS clearly exhibit still remaining\nhigh frequency information (which are much clearer in the\nHP case), almost no information is visible for SA and MM\nwhere the images are dominated by noise. This noise comes\nfrom the fact that on average 50% of the coefficients (no mat-\nter if high or low frequency) have been altered at their MSB\nin the binary representation which results in those randomly\nlooking images. Note that the replacement attack is not effec-\ntive in the case of SA and MM since no matter if directly re-\nconstructed or under the replacement attack always on aver-\nage 50% of the coefficents are altered at their MSB position.\nAlthough the results of SA and MM look rather satisfying\nfrom a security point of view, there is still visual information\nrelated to the original image left. Fig. 5 shows that this re-\nmaining information may be enhanced using simple image\nprocessing operations which leads to the conclusion that ob-\nviously MM is the most secure variant of our investigated\nselective encryption schemes and is the only one that can be\nsecurly operated at a level of encrypting 10% of the data.\nThe additionally encrypted DC coefficient makes MM much\nmore resistant against reconstruction as compared to SA.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[65,326,402,355],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[74,111,391,300]}
