","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The main difference between conditions for the drawing \nactivity involves single-user versus multi-user drawing. \nRemember that students in the paper condition were able to \nmove and rotate study materials, while students in the \ndigital condition did not have that option. As expected, \nstudents in the paper condition moved diagrams closer to \nthemselves when annotating, especially during the drawing \nactivity (Figure 7, left). Paper diagrams were rarely \npositioned in the middle of the table for both students to \nannotate. Again, we observed a serial work strategy around \npaper documents. In practice this means that one student \ndrew on the paper diagram while the other student watched, \nthus taking on a more passive role in the activity. On \noccasions, however, students in the paper condition \nswitched roles and passed the paper between them so each \ncould draw. \n","The digital medium affords multi-user drawing. Even if one \nstudent does most of the drawing, the digital table allows \nthe partner to reach in and add to the solution. We observed \nat least one instance of this multi-user drawing behavior in \neach study session with digital documents (Figure 7 and 8, \n"],"Page":6,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[447,852,766,897],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[452,712,763,847]}
