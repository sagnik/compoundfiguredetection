The interface is most \nappropriate for a small number of objects, and timing is \nimprecise, relying on users own hand gestures for timing. \nRotation, scaling, and simultaneous translation and rotation \nare also supported without overly complicating the \ninterface. Copying motion paths is also easy. \n Users draw on a blank canvas that contains only a slider \nbar for controlling position in time and a \u201CGO\u201D button that \nruns the animation (see Figure 6a). This allows seamless \ntransitions between drawing and animating. To define \nmotion, the user presses \u201CGO,\u201D and all drawings, \nmodifications, or pauses are recorded as if a video camera \nwere pointed at the canvas. When a drawn object is \nselected, the selection widget in Figure 5 appears. This \nwidget has multiple control zones so that users may specify \na variety of motions (such as translating or scaling) or \nother operations (such as moving the center of rotation). \nBy integrating many tools into one, this widget is similar to \nTracking Menus (Fitzmaurice et al. 2003), though it does \nnot follow a hovering pen as Tracking Menus do. \n After the user presses \u201CSTOP,\u201D visual feedback (a \nmotion path) becomes visible (see Figure 6b). This motion \npath can be deleted to erase the motion, modified to \nchange the path, or copied to apply it to a different object. \nAs shown in Figure 6d, more moving objects can be added \nby rewinding, drawing a new object, and pressing \u201CGO\u201D to \nstart the recording again. Objects will move as they have \nbeen defined to move, and the user can coordinate the \nmotion of new objects with her hands. This interface relies \non the user\u2019s intuitive sense of timing to make \ncoordination easy. Timing will be imprecise, but as we \nhave seen, precision is not always needed. \n Our design is best suited to supporting a small number \nof objects. However, there are some examples that require \nas many as 10, 20, or even 30 objects to be coordinated. \nWe may scale gracefully to larger numbers of objects by \n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[446,574,743,604],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[446,76,750,567]}
