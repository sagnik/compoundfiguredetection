{"Caption":"Figure 15: The original images are shown in figures (a) and (b). Figures (c) and (d) show the images after projecting the color of each pixel upon its color line. In Figures (e) and (f) the pixels are assigned to the mean color of their color lines. The number of Color Lines found for each of the images is 23.

In our version each category\u2019s folder\ncontains 20 images. We recovered color lines for 30 dif-\nferent categories. The results are presented in a table and\nshown in Figure 1. For each category we provide the av-\nerage number of lines found and the average reconstruction\nerror. It is possible to see that both the average number of\ncolor lines and the mean reconstruction error is affected by\nthe type of image. Landscape images can be usually de-\nscribed accurately using a small set of color lines, while\nhighly detailed ones require a larger number of lines. Iron-\nically, our algorithm did worst for the \u201Ccolor\u201D folder, but\nthis is not surprising, since most images there are either\nsynthetic or contain a large amount of reflections. Figure\n11 shows an example of a simple image and a complicated\none, two more examples are shown in Figure 15. Many\nother examples are found in the CD\n"],"Page":8,"Number":15,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,899,769,965],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[452,661,757,885]}
