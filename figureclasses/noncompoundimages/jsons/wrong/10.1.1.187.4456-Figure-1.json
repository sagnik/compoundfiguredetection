{"Caption":"Figure 1: Sample images from the MNIST dataset, with gray-scale from 0 to 255.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Each image in the MNIST dataset is represented by a 28 Ã— 28 gray-scale pixel-map, for\na total of 784 features. Each of the 10 digits has roughly 6,000 training examples and\n1,000 testing examples. Some of the samples are shown in Figure 1. From the perspective\nof using stochastic and online algorithms, the number of features and size of the dataset\nare considered very small. Nevertheless, we choose this dataset because the computational\nresults are easy to visualize. No preprocessing of the data is employed.\n"],"Page":21,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[152,319,696,336],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[147,139,708,301]}
