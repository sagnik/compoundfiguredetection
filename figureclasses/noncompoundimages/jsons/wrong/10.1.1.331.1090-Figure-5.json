","ImageText":[],"Mention":["x y\ndence about the facial expression. They represent the\nposition and orientation of the face model instead and\ntherefore, we do not consider them as features for the\ninterpretation process.\nTemporal features: Facial expressions also\nemerge from muscle activity and therefore, the mo-\ntion of particular feature points within the face is de-\nscriptive as well. Again, real-time capability is im-\nportant and therefore, a moderate number of feature\npoints within the area of the face model is consid-\nered only. The relative location of these points is\nconnected to the structure of the face model. Note\nthat we do not specify these locations manually, be-\ncause this assumes a good experience of the designer\nin analyzing facial expressions. In contrast, we au-\ntomatically generate a moderate number of G feature\npoints that are equally distributed, see Figure 5. We\nexpect these points to move uniquely and predictably\nin the case of a particular facial expression.
