It is\nclear from our results that the histogram of a natural im-\nage can be described well using a small set of color lines.\nFigure 9 shows the distance histogram between the original\npixels\u2019 colors and the color line best describing the pixel.\nThe mean distance is 5 gray (or color) levels. We should\nmention that the color information in many of the images\nin the dataset is very poor due to strong compression. We\ntherefore sometimes get artifacts that are clearly the result\nof JPEG compression as can be seen in figure 10. In spite\nof the above, for the large majority of images, our algorithm\nperform very well.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[79,295,409,322],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[106,128,388,282]}
