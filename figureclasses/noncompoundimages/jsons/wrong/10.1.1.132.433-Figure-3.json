the set of tuples to compute the aggregation value is the\nsame as that to compute the aggragation value of c2.\nIn our example in Figure 3(c), the cells between (S1,\n∗, P1, ∗) and (S1, C1, P1, D1) have identical\naggregation values.\n","The intuition is that the dimension values in a node are im-\nplied by the dimension values of its ancestors and its start\ndimension value. The dimension values of its ancestors are\nimplied by the ancestors\u2019 start dimension values. So all the\nstart dimension values of the node and its ancestors imply\nthe dimension values in the node. In the range trie of our\nexample(Figure 3), (S1, P1) → {D1} since P1 and S1\nare the start dimension values of the node (P1, D1) and\nits ancestor (S1, C1) seperately. Also, (S1)→ {C1}.\nThus, the set of dimension values implied by (S1, P1)\nis {C1, D1}, since (S1)→ {C1} leads to (S1, P1)→\n{C1} also. In general, given a node in a range trie with k\ndimensions on the node and its ancestors, and with l start\ndimensions for the node and its ancestors, Lemma 2 states\nthat the set of l start dimensions jointly implies those k − l\nnon-start dimensions.\nLemma 2 shows that a range trie identiﬁes data corre-\nlation among different dimension values.Lemma 3 explains\nthat data correlation captured in a range trie reveals cells\nsharing identical aggregation values.\n","Now if the key values of the chosen child node are all\nin the set of common dimension values, that is, all the di-\nmension values in the chosen child node appear in the tuple,\nthe root of a range trie is set to the chosen child node. The\ninsertion continues in the next iteration to insert the tuple\nwith fewer dimension values into the range trie rooted at\nthe previously chosen node. If the tuple (S1, C1, P3,\nD2) is to be inserted in the range trie shown in Figure 3(b),\nthe chosen child node (S1, C1) will not be changed. The\ndimension values left in the tuple will be (P3, D2) after\nremoving (S1, C1). The new iteration will insert the tu-\nple (P3, D2) to the range trie rooted at the node (S1,\nC1).\n","ues in the chosen child node are not in the set of common\ndimension values. If the smallest dimension in the chosen\nnode excluding the set of common dimensions is larger than\nthe start dimension of the child nodes of the chosen node,\nappend those non-common dimension values to all those\nchild nodes (line 16). Then, the new iteration continues with\nthe tuple with fewer dimensions and the range trie rooted at\nthe chosen node. This is the case when the tuple (S2,\nC3, P2, D2) is inserted to the range trie in Figure 3(b).\nThe child node (S2, P1, D2) is chosen to insert the tu-\nple. The set of common dimension values is {S2, D2} on\nthe dimensions Store, Date. The smallest of the non-\ncommon dimensions is Product which is larger than the\nstart dimension City of the child nodes of the chosen node,\ngiven the dimension order: Store, City, Product,\nDate. The set of non-common dimension values {P1} is\nappended to all the children, which become C1, P1 and\nC2, P1. The tuple (C3, P2) is inserted in the range trie\nrooted at the updated chosen node (S2, D2) in the next\niteration. This time no child node exists with the identi-\ncal start dimension value as C3. The insertion ends after a\nnew leaf node (C3, P2) is added as a child node of the\ncurrent root node (S2, D2), as shown in Figure 3(c). If\nthe smallest of the non-common dimensions in the chosen\nnode is smaller than the start dimension of its child nodes,\ncreate a new node which uses the set of non-common di-\nmension values as the key and inherit all the child nodes of\nthe chosen node as its children. Then, create another new\nleaf node which uses the remaining dimension values in the\ntuple as the key, and set these two new nodes as children\nof the chosen node. Here, if the chosen node is a leaf node\nitself, we assume the start dimension of its child nodes is\nalway largest. An example of this case occurs when the\ntuple (S1, C1, P2, D2) is inserted in the range trie\nshown in Figure 3(a). The non-common dimension values\nin the chosen node are P1, D1 and thus non-common di-\n","mensions are Product, Date, where the smallest non-\ncommon dimension is Product according to the dimen-\nsion order given before. It is smaller than the start dimen-\nsion of the child nodes of the chosen node(S1, C1, P1,\nD1), since we assume a leaf node has the largest possible\ndimension in its \u201Cchild nodes\u201D. The dimension values of the\nchosen node are replaced by (S1, C1), and a new node is\ncreated which has dimension values (P1, D1). Another\nnew leaf node is created with the dimension values left in\nthe tuple, P2 and D2, and both are set as the child nodes\nof the node (S1,C1). It is shown as the left branch in the\nFigure 3(b).\nThe range trie constructed from a dataset is invariant to\nthe order of data entry.The process of constructing a range\ntrie iteratively ﬁnds the common dimension values shared\nby a set of tuples, which is more than preﬁx sharing as in\nmany other tree-like structure.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[268,269,552,283],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[77,48,751,244]}
