{"Caption":"Figure 6. Relaxation of date ranges. One click selects an incident, two clicks selects the day on which the incident occurred, three clicks selects the entire week, four clicks selects the month. The images are cropped close-ups from the scatter plot in Figure 5b. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Consider the date-by-age scatter plot in Figure 5b. Clicking \nan individual item queries the backing data tuple. Figure 6 \ndepicts the use of repeated clicks to cycle through relaxed \nqueries for the date attribute, expanding the selection to \ninclude items in the same day, week, and month. In this \ncase, our query relaxer generates sequential relaxations by \ntraversing a semantic model of time. \n","our system generates text descriptions of selections. For \nexample, our captioner outputs \u201CAll items from August 1 to \nAugust 31\u201D for Figure 6 (right panel) and \u201CAll items with \nrace equal to \u201EWhite\u201F\u201D for Figure 7. \n","Hierarchies are a common structure for modeling a data \ndomain. For example, we can hierarchically organize time \ninto days, weeks, months, of years, as in the example shown \nin Figure 6. Similarly, we might hierarchically organize \ngeographic regions into neighborhoods, cities, counties, and \nstates. We can also generate semantic hierarchies in a data-\ndriven fashion. For instance, an analyst might apply \nhierarchical clustering (c.f., [5]) to analyze her data, and use \nthe resulting cluster trees to describe the data at different \nlevels of abstraction.  \n","To perform relaxation, we traverse these semantic \nhierarchies. With each relaxation step, the relaxer moves \none level higher in the hierarchy and generates a query that \nselects all values in the current sub-hierarchy.
