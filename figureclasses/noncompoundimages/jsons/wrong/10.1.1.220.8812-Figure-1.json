{"Caption":"Figure 1: The left figure shows a Segway robot, while the right figure shows the pioneer robots. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["by the team in a given time period, or conversely, the time\ntaken by a team to collect a percentage of the total hidden\ntreasure.\nIn our specific treasure hunt implementation, potential\nteam members include humans, Pioneer robots and the\nrobotic Segway RMP platform provided by Segway, LLC\n(see Figure 1). The Pioneer robot is equipped with a SICK\nlaser and gyroscope, and is therefore able to both construct\na map of an unknown environment, and localize itself upon\nthat map. The Segway robot has been outfitted with two\ncameras, by which it is able to visually identify both the Pi-\noneer robot and the treasure. The task assigned to the team\nis to search for and retrieve treasure. To explore an area\nwhile searching for the treasure, the Pioneer is able to nav-\nigate and build a map, while the Segway is able to follow\nthe Pioneer and simultaneously search for treasure. Upon\ntreasure identification, the robots must return home with the\ntreasure. By localizing on its created map, the Pioneer is\nable to determine the home location; the Segway then fol-\nlows the Pioneer as it proceeds home. Team coordination\nbetween the robots during execution is accomplished jointly\nvia the visual identification of the Pioneer by the Segway,\nand by communication between the two robots should this\nvisual link be lost (in which case the Pioneer is commanded\nto pause while the Segway searches for it). Communication\nadditionally occurs when the Segway informs the Pioneer\nthat treasure has been found.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[442,717,775,747],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[463,497,756,702]}
