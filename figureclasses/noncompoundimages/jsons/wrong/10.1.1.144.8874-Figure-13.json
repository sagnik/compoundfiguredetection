We add a Laplacian\nmodel terms to each of the RANS equations: the element-wise shock indicator is based on the components\nof the Koornwinder decomposition of the density, and equal amounts of viscosity are added to all the RANS\nequations. Figure 10 shows the steady-state p = 4 solution (Mach number) and artificial diffusion added\nto the RANS equations. Our shock indicator identifies the elements around the shock, and no viscosity is\nadded to the elements further away. Hence, the shock is sharp and well-resolved within only one element.\nIn Figure 12, Mach number plots for both p = 3 and p = 4 solutions show that the shock is sharper with\nhigher-order approximations. We furthermore present in Figure 13 the pressure distribution and skin-friction\ndistribution over the upper airfoil surface. We note that that for p = 3 and p = 4 both the pressure and\nskin friction coefficients are essentially grid independent, whereas for the p = 2 significant differences are\nobserved in skin friction.\n"],"Page":14,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,427,750,452],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[107,606,745,872]}
