However, the power of the active \nparts is still kept the same (high-leakage). The core idea \nof the proposed cache architecture is to minimize power \ndensity of the active parts in the cache. Figure 2 \nillustrates a simple example of this idea using two banks. \nIn Figure 2(a), Bank 0 is turned on while Bank 1 is \nturned off to save power as it is commonly done. On the \nother hand, Figure 2(b) turns off alternating rows of both \nbanks, thereby halving the power density of the rows that \nare in active mode. While the number of rows turned off \nis the same in both cases, the reduction in the power \ndensity in Figure 2(b) lowers the junction temperature, \nresulting in an exponential reduction in the leakage of \nthe active rows. Thus, the leakage power of the active \nrows is reduced in addition to the eliminated power of the \ninactive parts that are turned off. This proposed cache \narchitecture is called Power density-Minimized \nArchitecture (PMA) hereafter in this paper. Although \nthe notion of PMA can be applied to different power \nreduction techniques, in this paper, we use a scheme that \n"],"Page":2,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[453,220,748,240],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[477,87,724,220]}
