different models are shown in Figure 3a. In particular, the average reconstruction\nerrors of HMDP for each of the five ancestors are 0.026, 0.078, 0.116, 0.168, and 0.335,\nrespectively. There is a good correlation between the reconstruction quality and the\npopulation frequency of each ancestor. Specifically, the average (over all simulated\npopulations) fraction of SNP loci originated from each ancestor among all loci in the\npopulation is 0.472, 0.258, 0.167, 0.068 and 0.034, respectively. As one would expect,\nthe higher the population frequency of an ancestor is, the better its reconstruction ac-\ncuracy. Interestingly, under the fixed-dimensional HMM, even when we use the correct\nnumber of ancestor states, i.e., K = 5, the reconstruction error is still very high (Fig-\nure 3), typically 2.5 times or higher than the error of HMDP.
