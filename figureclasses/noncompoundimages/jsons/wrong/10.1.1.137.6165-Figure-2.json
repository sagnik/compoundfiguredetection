A dedicated distribution manager is deployed\nto control a set of CAPE processors.\nEach CAPE processor has a central continuous\nquery processing engine responsible for executing op-\nerators that are activated in this processor. The data\nreceiver receives tuples from stream sources or other\nprocessors, feeding them into the right operators in the\nprocessor. The data distributor, on the other hand,\nsends output tuples to operators in different proces-\nsors. The local statistics gatherer continuously collects\nstatistics for the current processor.

For example,\nthe load can be measured based on the output rate\nat which an operator sends tuples across the network.\nThe load can also be estimated by the sum of the costs\nof all active operators on that processor. The mem-\nory consumption can be a good indicator of load as\nwell. Experiments in our prototype system show that\nthe number of network connections (network costs) in\na processor is often a non-trivial cost factor. Figure 2\nillustrates the CPU costs incurred when the number of\nnetwork connections increases.
