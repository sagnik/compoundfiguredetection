Figure 3 pro-\nvides a conceptual overview of the SNMP anomaly de-\ntection module. Speci\u0002cally, we are interested in \u0003ow\nanomalies on customer-facing interfaces, since volume\nbased DDoS attacks will be most visible at the egress\nlinks of the customers under attack. SNMP data is col-\nlected on an on-going basis at most providers, and typi-\ncally contains CPU and link loads (in terms of octet and\npacket) counts. Since most DDoS attacks use small pack-\nets we use the egress packet counts (i.e., with reference\nto Figure 1, the C-PE interface towards the customer) to\ndetect volume anomalies.\nTo keep the operational, storage, and computation re-\nsources low, we devised a simple trigger algorithm with\ngood performance. Conceptually, the algorithm builds\na prediction model which indicates the expected mean\nand expected variance for the traf\u0002c time series. Using\nthis model it assigns a deviation score to current observa-\ntions, in terms of the number of standard deviations away\nfrom the mean that each observation is found to be. Bor-\nrowing some formal notation [26] one can think of the\ntraf\u0002c time series, denoted by T (t) as being composed\nof three components, T (t) = P (t)+V (t)+A(t), where\nP (t) represents the predicted mean traf\u0002c rate, V (t) rep-\nresents the stochastic noise that one expects for the traf-\n\u0002c, and A(t) is the anomaly component. Our goal is\nto obtain models for P (the periodic component) and V\n(the stochastic component), so that we can identify the\nanomaly component A in future traf\u0002c measurements.\nOur algorithm, depicted in Figure 4, works as follows.\nFor each customer interface, we take the last k weeks\nof data (this historical time-series data is referred to as\nTS ).
