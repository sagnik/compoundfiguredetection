The\nsolid black symbols with numbers show the correct posi-\ntions of the measurement points. The outline open symbols\nrepresent the estimated positions (ten estimates) based on\nthe pointing measurements.

Finally, the symbols with the dot in the middle\nare the estimated positions obtained by the guidedmeasure-\nments. To make the findings a bit easier to understand, we\nenclosed the measurement results for each point with a dot-\nted line. We also adopted different shaped symbols (trian-\ngles, squares, circles), just to make the results easier to dis-\ncriminate. Measurement results for the same point are rep-\nresented using the same symbol shape.\n","An experiment was carried out on the prototype system\nto evaluate the accuracy of the proposed position estima-\ntion method. We are confident that our method will prove\neffective across a wide range of environments both indoor\nand outdoor, but the trial was conducted in an outdoor envi-\nronment that is little affected by geomagnetic disturbances.\nFig. 8 shows a schematic overview of the trial site.\nMarkers were set up in two locations at opposite ends of\na building (Building A in the figure). The distance between\nthe two markers was 30.5 meters. The proposed method\nwas used to estimate the positions of 20 different points\nscattered in the vicinity of the markers. A measuring de-\nvice consists of the 3DM direction sensor [7] for azimuth\nmeasurements and a guide stick to help aiming.
