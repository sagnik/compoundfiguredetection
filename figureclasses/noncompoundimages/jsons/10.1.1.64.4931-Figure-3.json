With a single agent per node, these subnets still \npresent multi-agent coordination problems.  Within this \nframework, single nodes may belong to multiple adjacent \nsubnets.  While much sensor network literature predicts \nfuture networks on the order of hundreds or thousands of \nnodes, practical solutions to the presented problem can be \naccomplished with tens of nodes per subnet.  At the same \ntime that this scale makes the problem presently tractable, \nit also provides barriers to successful use of probabilistic \ntechniques. \n Research shows that different users not only have \ndifferent preferences from one another, but also have \nwidely varying lighting preferences for different tasks \n(Granderson et al. 2004).  Two models are considered for \nachieving user preferences: workspace-based (Figure 2) \nand user-based (Figure 3) configurations. \n If a single workspace maps to an individual user, the \nworkspace-based preference model is acceptable.  This \nmodel requires occupancy sensors to determine the \npresence of an individual, but does not reliably distinguish \nbetween users because of technical limitations of the \nsensors. \n The more flexible user-based model entails the use of \nsensor nodes for user identification.  While some \nresearchers have integrated badges into their building \ncontrol systems (Boman, Davidsson, and Younes 1999), \nothers have indicated a need for less invasive approaches \n(Brooks 1997).  Much as individuals in office \nenvironments carry RFID (radio frequency identification) \naccess control badges, they could carry small-scale sensor \nnodes embedded in their identification cards.  These nodes \nwould be used to identify users to local sensors, and would \ncontain lighting preference information. In this \nconfiguration, photosensors would still be located at the \nwork surface; it would not be necessary to have occupancy \nsensors, as the identification nodes would assume their \nfunction.  This system is more amenable to the addition, \ndeletion, or modification of user preferences, since all the \nrelevant information is stored on the identification nodes. \n Adoption of the user-based configuration is highly \ndependent on privacy concerns.  It remains unclear as to \nwhether users will be willing to carry nodes to support the \nfunction of the intelligent lighting system.  Unwillingness \nto participate presents an insurmountable barrier to the \nselection of this model. \n"],"Page":2,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,912,752,960],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[147,699,654,905]}
