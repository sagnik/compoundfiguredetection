Like\nother visualization tools, LaNet-vi assumes an unweighted network\nand thus we must first use a threshold on the weights (similari-\nties) to select edges. However, as shown in Figure 3, the similarity\nis distributed broadly, over three orders of magnitudes. This sug-\ngests that any threshold value on the similarity weights will lead to\na loss of important structural information. Figure 3 also suggests\nthat s ≈ 0.03 is the critical region in which the weight distribution\ntransitions into a power-law tail, and therefore this is the critical\nregion where we expect to find interesting threshold values for the\nsimilarity. Therefore we visualize in Figure 4 three versions of the\n","network corresponding to thresholds in this critical region. For high\nthreshold values (s > 0.04) we can identify different clusters cor-\nresponding to those in Figure 2. As we consider more edges, this\ncluster structure is gradually lost as we gain more information on\nthe topology. For s > 0.02 the network becomes very hierarchical\nand layered; the number of cores reaches 90. We also note that the\ndegree of nodes appears to be strongly correlated with their central-\nity; intuitively general pages are similar to more pages than specific\nones. Due to the sparsity of the similarity matrix and the distribu-\ntion of s (cf. Figure 3), the majority of nodes appear isolated at\nthese threshold values and are not displayed; we see at most 419 of\nthe 22,065 URLs (s > 0.02).\nAnother way to analyze the GiveALink similarity network is to\ncompare it with other ways to estimate semantic similarity between\nthe bookmarked Web pages.
