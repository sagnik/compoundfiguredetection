{"Caption":"Figure 1: The co-axial pen with 3 optional nibs (left). Below           a ruler provides an indication of scale . ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["In the early stages of the project we investigated a number of\nways of detecting the pattern, including a comb reader with a\nlarge number of points of contact that could detect signals by\nbeing held in one place, and a swipe wand that was operated\nthrough a short movement. Although there were advantages\nand disadvantages with each, it emerged that the swiping\napproach was the more flexible and robust solution. It may\nalso be noted that for most activities of users there would be\nsome movement of the pen. Nevertheless the pen would have\nto be designed so that it could be held in either hand in any\norientation and might be quite roughly handled. As the inks\nare conductive, only a simple reading device is really needed.\nFor example, initial nibs were adapted versions of\nconventional brass fountain pens with the nib split to provide\nthe two points of contact. To overcome undue abrasion on the\nsurface different arrangements of the two points were\ndeveloped. The current nib has a concentric design, one\nelectrode surrounding the other. In appearance it appears\nsimilar to a large highlighter pen with a ballpoint nib. In\noperation the central electrode is similar to those found in\nelectrical test equipment or in some printers (see Figure 1).\n"],"Page":5,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[444,662,771,692],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,504,784,663]}
