In this \nsection, we perform a 3D metric reconstruction of a \nreal object from two omnidirectional images, by using \nthe sensor model estimated by our calibration proce-\ndure. In order to compare the reconstruction results \nwith a ground truth, we exploited a trihedral object \ncomposed of three orthogonal checker patterns of \nknown geometry (see Fig. 8).  \n"],"Page":6,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,524,744,555],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[498,361,687,509]}
