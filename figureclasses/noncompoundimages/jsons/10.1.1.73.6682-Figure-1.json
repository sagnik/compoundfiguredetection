Both receivers\nhave been realized as fully quantized 16 bit ﬁxed\u2013point implementations on a DSP. In each of\nthe following cases, results for the raw bit error rate (RawBER) before decoding, the frame\nerror rate (FER) after decoding, and the residual BER (RBER) for the Class 1b coded bits\n[11] are given.\nFirst, the cochannel interference test case speciﬁed in [13] is considered (a single ran-\ndom GMSK modulated cochannel interferer). Fig. 1 shows error rates versus the carrier\u2013\nto\u2013interference ratio C\/I. Here, C and I are the average received power of the desired signal\nand the interferer, respectively. The results indicate that more than 11 dB can be gained by\nMIC compared to a standard receiver at FER \u0019 10\u00002 as well as RBER \u0019 10\u00002. In comparison,\nthe gains of the SAIC algorithm proposed in [3] are limited to about 6 dB for a similar scenario,\ncf. Fig. 6 of [3].\nAccording to Fig. 2, similar gains can be obtained for the adjacent channel interference\ntest case speciﬁed in [13]. For all GSM receivers, an adjacent channel protection (ACP) of\nat least 18 dB is desirable [13]. Here, an ACP of 18 dB means that performance in case of\ncochannel interference and in case of adjacent channel interference with an 18 dB higher average\ninterference power are equal. A high ACP is important especially for systems with low reuse\nfactor, because adjacent channels then might be often used in neighboring cells or other sectors\nof the same base station. This potentially results in strong adjacent channel interference due\nto near\u2013far eﬀects, as has been shown in ﬁeld trials [14]. According to Figs. 1 and 2, an ACP\nof 18 dB is approximately fulﬁlled for MIC.\nIn practical applications, it is important that a receiver performs well not only in interference\u2013\nlimited but also in coverage\u2013limited scenarios. Therefore, the reference sensitivity test case [13],\nwhich is characterized by a white Gaussian noise disturbance, is also investigated.
