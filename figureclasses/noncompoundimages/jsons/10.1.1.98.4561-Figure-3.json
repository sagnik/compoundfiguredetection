In fact, the\nsituation is somewhat worse than that, since some of these\n37 addresses are not available for assignment due to various\nDHCP violations (discussed in Section 4.2).\nIn Figure 3 we plot the number of leases that are explicitly\nreleased by the clients hourly. Such leases can be immedi-\nately re-assigned to other hosts. In most cases, leases that\nare allowed to expire by their owners are not used just prior\nto the expiration, which is wasteful. In order to reduce such\nwastage, the DHCP server of the Network-A instructs clients\nto release their leases on shutdown.\nThere is an inverse relationship between graphs in the\nFigure 2 (number of active leases) and Figure 3 (number of\nlease releases). For example, at the end of each day, as a\nnumber of users turn o\u000B their computers, leases are released\nand correspondingly the number of active leases goes down.\nIn fact, lease release peaks occur between 4pm and 5pm\non most weekdays. On Fridays the peak occurs somewhat\nearlier, around 2pm, due to users leaving work early for the\nweekend.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[480,634,729,647],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[434,391,769,617]}
