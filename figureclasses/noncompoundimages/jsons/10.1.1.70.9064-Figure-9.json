The NBA data set contains 339, 721 records\nabout 1, 313 players. We treat each player as an uncertain\nobject and the records of the player as the instances of the\nobject. Three attributes are selected in our analysis: num-\nber of points, number of assists, and number of rebounds.\nThe larger those attribute values, the better.\nTable 2 shows the 0.1-skyline players in the skyline prob-\nability descending order. We also conducted the traditional\nskyline analysis. We calculated the average statistics for\neach player on each attribute. That is, each player has only\none record in the aggregate data set. We computed the sky-\nline on the aggregate data set, which is called the aggregate\nskyline for short hereafter. All skyline players in the aggre-\ngate skyline are annotated by a \u201C*\u201D sign in Table 2. We\nobtain several interesting observations.\nFirst, the top-12 players with the largest skyline probabil-\nity are also in the aggregate skyline. All of them are great\nplayers. Those players not only have good average perfor-\nmance so that they are in the aggregate skyline, but also\nperformed outstandingly in some games so that they have a\nhigh skyline probability.\nSecond, some players that are not in the aggregate skyline\nmay still have a high skyline probability. There are 22 play-\ners who are not in the aggregate skyline, but have a higher\nskyline probability than Odom who is a skyline player in the\naggregate data set.\nOlajuwon is an example. In the aggregate data set, he is\ndominated by four other players: O\u2019Neal, Barkley, Duncan,\nand Webber. In Figure 9, we sample the records of the five\nplayers with rate 5% (so that the figure is readable) and plot\ntheir number of rebounds and number of points. Olajuwon\nhas some records (e.g., 40 points and 19 rebounds) dominate\nmost records of other players. On the other hand, he also\nhas some records (e.g., 0 point and 3 rebounds) that are\ndominated by many records of other players.
