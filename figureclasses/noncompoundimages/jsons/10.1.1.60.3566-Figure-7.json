AMLs extend the notion of mixin layers [32]\nby encapsulating besides mixins also aspects (see Fig. 7).\nIn fact an AML encapsulates roles of classes and aspects\nthat contribute to a collaboration, i.e. that implements a\nfeature. By applying an AML to a set of features the pro-\ngrammer can refine these features in two ways: (1) by using\ncommon mixin-composition4 or (2) by using aspect-oriented\nmechanisms, e.g. pointcuts and advice.
