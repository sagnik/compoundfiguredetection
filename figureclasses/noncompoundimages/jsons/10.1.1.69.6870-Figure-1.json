Along with each recognized \nword, ViaVoice reports a \u201Cphrase score,\u201D which is \ndocumented as follows: \u201C[it] is not a confidence\u2026 it is an \naverage acoustic score per second. The acoustic score \ndepends on the quality of the match and the length of the \nspeech aligned with the word.\u201D [19] To better understand the \nmeaning of phrase score in relation to the speech recordings \nused in the evaluation, the recordings were hand-transcribed. \nThese transcripts were then compared with the speech-\nrecognizer-generated ones.
