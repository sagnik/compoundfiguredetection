Sam-\npling from this induced distribution results in an MDP\nM = m with probability Pr(M = mj\u0002 = \u0012; C = c).\nThis addition of a \\class layer\" makes the probabil-\nity model hierarchical. Intuitively, the hierarchical\nBayesian approach allows us to explicitly reason about\nthe shared structure of certain MDPs and to transfer\nknowledge to a new MDP from those in the same class.\n","Our approach to multi-task reinforcement learning can\nbe viewed as extending Bayesian RL to a multi-task\nsetting. In (single-task) Bayesian model-based RL, a\nposterior probability distribution P (M j\u0002; O) is main-\ntained over possible MDPs, where M denotes a ran-\ndom variable over MDPs, O is the current set of ob-\nservations from the underlying MDP, and \u0002 denotes\nthe parameters of the probability model (Figure 1(a)).\nThis distribution is used to select actions and is re\fned\n","We propose a generative model corresponding to the\nclass structure illustrated in Figure 1(b).
