{"Caption":"Figure 4: Tranformations learned by Non-local MP. The top row shows digits taken from the USPS training set, and the two following rows display the results of steps taken by one of the 7 principal directions learned by Non-local MP, the third one corresponding to more steps than the second one. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Experiments on Classification by Density Estimation. The USPS data set was used\nto perform a classification experiment. The original training set (7291) was split into a\ntraining (first 6291) and validation set (last 1000), used to tune hyper-parameters. One\ndensity estimator for each of the 10 digit classes is estimated. For comparison we also\nshow the results obtained with a Gaussian kernel Support Vector Machine (already used\nin (Vincent and Bengio, 2003)). Non-localMP* refers to the variation described in (Bengio\nand Larochelle, 2005), which attemps to train faster the components with larger variance.\nThe t-test statistic for the null hypothesis of no difference in the average classification\nerror on the test set of 2007 examples between Non-local MP and the strongest competitor\n(Manifold Parzen) is shown in parenthesis.
