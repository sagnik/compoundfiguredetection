The total channel\nbandwidth is about 26 Mbps in the 802.11a based network\nwhen operating in the 54 Mbps mode. Figure 4 shows the\namount of bandwidth received by the video stream. We ob-\nserved that the throughput received by the video stream is\nvirtually identical to what it received in the absence of any\ninterference. In addition, the total bandwidth of the video\nstream and the interferer was observed to be close to the\nchannel capacity of 26 Mbps. This shows how ARGOS over\nour 802.11 extension layer can be provisioned to isolate real-\ntime tra\u000Ec \rows such as video streams without impacting\nthe total throughput of the channel.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,661,772,690],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[443,436,747,651]}
