To this end, users click a \n\u2018Settings\u2019 button on the browser toolbar to bring up a band that \ncontains a series of control panels (see browser\u2019s otherwise \nstandard toolbar buttons in Figure 1). The band appears at the \nbottom of the browser displaying the first of the control panels \n(see Figure 2 which shows the panel for setting \u2018text size\u2019). To \nmake the Web page text larger, the user simply clicks on the \nbutton showing the larger size, as shown in Figure 2. \n","For some adaptations, such as keyboard adjustments, banner text \ndisplay, and speak text, the results of the adaptations are not \nimmediately apparent on the Web page. Rather, the effect \nbecomes apparent once the user types or points at text.   For \nadaptations that effect the global page presentation, however, the \nrequested changes are immediately applied to the current Web \npage. Clicking the larger text button shown in Figure 2 \nimmediately increases the size of the text. If the user does not like \nthe results of the change, they can easily adjust it. \n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[88,329,390,360],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[71,73,409,319]}
