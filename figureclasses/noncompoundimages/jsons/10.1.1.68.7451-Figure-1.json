The architecture of\nthe model is shown in figure 1. It consists of two trainable\ncomponents. The first component is the parametric function\nG(W,X), parameterized with W , that takes X as input and\nproduces an output m = G(W,X). This output can be in-\nterpreted as the \u201Cintrinsic price\u201D of the sample. Other than\ndifferentiability with respect toW , no restriction is imposed\non the form\/architecture of this function. For the house\nprice prediction application, the function G(W,X) was a\nfully connected neural network with two hidden layers.\nThe second component H(D,X) models the latent man-\nifold and is non-parametric in nature. In the light of house\nprice prediction, as pointed out in the previous section, the\nprice of the house P with a set of features X, is strongly\naffected by the \u201Cdesirability\u201D of its neighbourhood. This\n\u201Cdesirability\u201D (which can be viewed as a smooth manifold\nspanning the concerned geographic region) is modeled by\nassigning a \u201Cdesirability coefficient\u201D di to each training sam-\nple Xi.
