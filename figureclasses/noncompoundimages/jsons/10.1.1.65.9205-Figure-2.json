as given by (15). These two measures provide an evolving\nnumber of hits per profile relative to each of the above criteria, as\nshown in Figures 2 - 7, for the two different learning similarity\noptions, and the three above scenarios respectively. The y-axis is\nsplit into 20 intervals, with each interval devoted to the trend\/profile\nnumber indicated by the lower value (from 0 to 19). A hit for the\nith profile for session No. t is shown in these figures at location\n(t, i), and indicates the presence of at least one B-cell profile that\nachieved the desired threshold in the validation measures of preci-\nsion or coverage.\nThe proposed immune clustering algorithm can learn the user\nprofiles in a single pass. A single pass over all 1704 Web user ses-\nsions (with non-optimized Java code) took less than 7 seconds on a\n2 GHz Pentium 4 PC running on Linux. With an average of 4 mil-\nliseconds per user session, the proposed profile mining system is\nsuitable for use in a real time personalization system to constantly\nand continuously provide a fresh and current list of an unknown\nnumber of evolving user profiles. Old profiles can be handled in a\nvariety of ways. They may either be discarded, moved to secondary\nstorage, or cached for possible re-emergence. Even if discarded,\nolder profiles that re-emerge later, would be re-learned from scratch\njust like new profiles. Hence the logistics of maintaining old pro-\nfiles are less crucial compared to existing techniques.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,878,408,905],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[56,31,427,863]}
