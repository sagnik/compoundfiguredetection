data is often modelled as labelled and ordered tree\nor graph. Naturally twig (a small tree) pattern becomes an\nessential part of many XML queries. A twig pattern can\nbe represented as a node-labelled tree whose edges are ei-\nther Parent-Child (P-C) or Ancestor-Descendant (A-D) re-\nlationship. For example, the following twig pattern written\nin XPath[19] format:\nsection[\/title]\/paragraph\/\/figure ........ (Q1)\nselects figure elements which are descendants of some para-\ngraph elements which in turn are children of section ele-\nments having at least one child element title.\nPrior work on XML twig pattern processing usually de-\ncomposes a twig pattern into a set of binary relationships\n","and endPos are calculated by performing a pre-order (doc-\nument order) traversal of the document tree; startPos is\nthe number in sequence assigned to an element when it is\nfirst encountered and endPos is equal to one plus the end-\nPos of the last element visited. Leaf elements have start-\nPos equal to endPos. LevelNum is the level of a certain\nelement in its data tree. Element A is a descendant of El-\nement B if and only if startPos(A) > startPos(B) and\nendPos(A) < endPos(B).
