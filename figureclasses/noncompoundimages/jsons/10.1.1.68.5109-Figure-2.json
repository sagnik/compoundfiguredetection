{"Caption":"Figure 2. User study files and tally: Molecular files from each of the laptops (left, center), and resulting tally (right). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Each laptop contained one image of a molecule from a pair of \nmolecular images. The subjects were each asked to copy their \nimage onto the UbiTable so that there was a pair of molecular \nimages on the table after the copy-to-table operation. The subjects \nwere asked to count the combined total number of atoms in the \ntwo molecules. The subjects were then asked to create a draw \npane on the table, use it to record the total number of atoms in the \npair of molecules, and then save this draw pane on both laptops. \nAn example pair of molecule images and the screen shot of the \nresulting tally are shown in Figure 2. Finally, subjects were asked \nto exchange molecule images with each other and save their \npartner\u2019s image on their own laptop. \n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,854,776,885],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[455,751,778,837]}
