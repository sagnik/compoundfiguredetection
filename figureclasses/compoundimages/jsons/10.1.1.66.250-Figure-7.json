{"Caption":"Figure 7: The combination of filtering, neighbor decay, and height lead to substantially more accurate coordinates on PlanetLab nodes participating in the Azureus network coordinate system. Comparing 2 D + H to 4 D + H, the data show a 43% improvement in relative error and a four orders-of-magnitude improvement in stability.
