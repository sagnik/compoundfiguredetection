{"Caption":"Figure 4: Three coupled time series, where series 1 and series 2 predict series 3. Forecast- ing for series 3 begins after 100 time steps where t = 7.8. The dependent model forecast is shown with a solid line, and the independent (control) forecast is shown with a broken line. The dependent model does a far better job at forecasting the next 10 steps of series 3 (black dots).

We simulated a set of three time series for 100 steps each (figure 4) where\nseries 3 was positively coupled to a lagged version of series 1 (lag = 0:5) and negatively\ncoupled to a lagged version of series 2 (lag = 0:6). Given the 300 observations, we built\na dependent GP model of the three time series and compared them with independent GP\nmodels. The dependent GP model incorporated a prior belief that series 3 was coupled to\nseries 1 and 2, with the lags unknown. The independent GP model assumed no coupling\nbetween its outputs, and consisted of three independent GP models. We queried the models\nfor forecasts of the future 10 values of series 3. It is clear from figure 4 that the dependent\nGP model does a far better job at forecasting the dependent series 3. The independent\nmodel becomes inaccurate after just a few time steps into the future. This inaccuracy is\nexpected as knowledge of series 1 and 2 is required to accurately predict series 3.
