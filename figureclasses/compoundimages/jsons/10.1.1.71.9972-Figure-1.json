Figure 1 shows the Hinge and Smooth\nHinge loss functions. The Smooth Hinge shares many\nproperties with the Hinge, but is much easier to optimize\ndirectly via gradient descent methods. Like the Hinge, the\nSmooth Hinge is not sensitive to outliers, and does not\ncontinuously \u201Creward\u201D the model for increasing the output\nvalue for an example. This contrasts with other smooth loss\nfunctions, such as the truncated quadratic (which is sensi-\ntive to outliers) and the Logistic (which \u201Crewards\u201D large\noutput values).
