{"Caption":"Figure 3: Responses from the Two-Level Hierarchical Network. (A) Top panel: Input image (lasting the first 15 time steps) containing a vertical bar (\u201CReference\u201D) on the right side. Each in- put was convolved with a retinal spatiotemporal filter. Middle: Three sample spike trains from the 1st level neuron whose preferred stimulus was a vertical bar on the right side. Bottom: Posterior probability of a vertical bar (= spiking probability or instantaneous firing rate of the neuron) plotted over time. (B) Top panel: An input containing two stimuli (\u201CPair\u201D). Below: Sample spike trains and posterior probability for the same neuron as in (A). (C) When \u201Cattention\u201D is focused on the right side (depicted by the white oval) by initializing the prior probability encoded by the 2nd level right-coding neuron at a higher value than the left-coding neuron, the firing rate for the 1st level neuron in (A) in- creases to a level comparable to that in (A). (D) Responses from a neuron in primate area V4 without attention (top panel, Ref Att Away and Pair Att Away; compare with (A) and (B)) and with attention (bottom panel, Pair Att Ref; compare with (C)) (from [17]). Similar responses are seen in V2 [17].
