{"Caption":"Figure 13: Comparison of PNS techniques. \u201CNo PNS\u201D is the control case, where proximity is ignored. \u201CGlobal Sampling\u201D uses the lookup function to sample all nodes in the DHT. \u201CNN\u201D is sampling our neighbor\u2019s neighbors, and \u201CNIN\u201D is sampling their inverse neighbors. The recursive versions of \u201CNN\u201D and \u201CNIN\u201D mimic the nearest-neighbor algorithms of Pastry and Tapestry, respectively. Note that the scales are different between the two figures.

For example, global sampling at a high enough rate\nrelative to the churn rate would achieve perfect proxim-\nity, but at the cost of a very large number of lookups and\nlatency probes. To make this comparison, then, we ran\neach algorithm (and some combinations of them) at var-\nious periods, then plotted the mean lookup latency under\nchurn versus bandwidth used. The results for median ses-\nsion times of 47 minutes are shown in Figure 13, which is\nsplit into two graphs for clarity.\n","configuration that is not using PNS. With virtually no in-\ncrease in bandwidth, global sampling drops the mean la-\ntency from 450 ms to 340 ms.\nNext, much to our surprise, we find that simple sam-\npling of our neighbor\u2019s neighbors or inverse neighbors is\nnot terribly effective. As we argued above, this result may\nbe in part due to the constraints of the routing table, but\nwe did not expect the effect to be so dramatic. On the\nother hand, the recursive versions of both algorithms are\nat least as effective as global sampling, but not much more\nso. This result agrees with the contention of Gummadi et\nal. that only a small amount of global sampling is neces-\nsary to achieve near-optimal PNS.\nFigure 13(b) shows several combinations of the vari-\nous algorithms. Global sampling plus sampling of neigh-\nbors\u2019 neighbors\u2014the combination used in our earlier\nwork [23]\u2014does well, offering a small decrease in la-\ntency without much additional bandwidth. However, the\nother combinations offer similar results. At this point, it\nseems prudent to say that the most effective technique is to\ncombine global sampling with any other technique. While\nthere may be other differences between the techniques not\nrevealed by this analysis, we see no clear reason to prefer\none over another as yet.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,327,750,391],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[140,100,696,316]}
