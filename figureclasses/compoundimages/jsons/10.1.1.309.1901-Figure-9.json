because our random actions are controlled by\nthe real statistics, the deviation is limited in the long run.\nThe graphs for unique chunks have an initial peak be-\ncause there is only one snapshot at first, and there are not\nmany duplicates in a single snapshot. As expected, this\npeak moves to the right in the graphs for chunks with\none and two duplicates.\nThe Homes dataset has a second peak in all graphs\naround 10\u201312 snapshots (Figure 8). This point corre-\nsponds to two missing weekly snapshots. The first was\nmissed due to a power outage; the second was missed be-\ncause our scan did not recover properly from the power\noutage. As a result, the 10th snapshot contributes many\nmore unique chunks in the dataset than the others.\nThe MacOS dataset contains daily, not weekly snap-\nshots. Daily changes in the system are more sporadic\nthan weekly ones: one day users and applications add\na lot of new data, the next many files are copied, etc.\nFigure 9 therefore contains many small variations.\nTable 4 shows the relative error for emulated param-\neters at the end of each run. Maximum deviation did\nnot exceed 15% and averaged 6% for all parameters and\ndatasets. We also analyzed the file size, type, and di-\nrectory depth distributions in the final dataset. Figure 12\ndemonstrates these for several representative datasets. In\nall cases the accuracy was fairly high, within 2%.\nThe snapshots in our datasets change a lot. For exam-\nple, the deduplication ratio is less than 5 in our Kernels\ndataset, even though the number of snapshots is 40. We\nexpect the accuracy of our system to be higher for the\ndatasets that change slower; for instance, datasets with\nidentical snapshots are emulated without any error.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[433,386,745,414],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[433,99,747,385]}
