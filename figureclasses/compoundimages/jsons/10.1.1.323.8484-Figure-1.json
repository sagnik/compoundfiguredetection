The random predictor is\nbuilt according to a probability distribution based on the prior knowledge of selection frequency of\neach interest; interests with unbalanced distribution in the population can be predicted more easily.\nIn Figure 1 (right) we plot the cumulative distribution of interest selection frequency in each data\nset (i.e., how many times an interest was selected). We can observe that some very popular interests\nare selected by almost half of the two populations and that a small set of interests concern only a\nfew participants.\n","The parameter k, defining the number of neighbours, plays a key role in the accuracy of the algo-\nrithm. We experiment with k = 1, ..., 10. Figure 1 (left) shows that the biggest improvement in\nterms of prediction performance correspond to the values k equal to 3 and 5. There is no significant\nincrease in performance beyond 5-NN for both data sets. An explanation of this behaviour is that\nas we go beyond 5-NN , although the information over the distribution of interests in a population\nincreases, we move away from a person\u2019s social ties which are expected to share similar interest\npreferences.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,276,700,306],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[236,119,604,258]}
