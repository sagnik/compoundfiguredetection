In practical datasets,\nthere can be clusters of different scales, where a global analysis with a single ε is not suit-\nable. As an example consider the second dataset in figure 1, with three clusters. While\nthe first eigenvector distinguishes between the large cluster and the two smaller ones, the\nsecond eigenvector captures the equilibration inside the large cluster instead of further dis-\ntinguishing the two small clusters. While a theoretical explanation is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, a possible solution is to choose a location dependent ε, as proposed in [26].\n","Case II: Consider a uniform density in a region Ω ⊂ R3 composed of two large con-\ntainers connected by a narrow circular tube, as in the top right frame in figure 1. In this\ncase U(x) = const, so the second term in (17) vanishes. As shown in [27], the second\neigenvalue of the FP operator is extremely small, of the order of a\/V where a is the radius\nof the connecting tube and V is the volume of the containers, thus showing an interesting\nconnection to the Cheeger constant on graphs. The corresponding eigenfunction is almost\npiecewise constant in each container with a sharp transition in the connecting tube. Even\nthough in this case the density is uniform, there still is a spectral gap with two well defined\nclusters (the two containers), defined entirely by the geometry of Ω. An example of such a\ncase and the results of the diffusion map are shown in figure 1 (right).\n"],"Page":7,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,334,675,379],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[299,103,555,318]}
