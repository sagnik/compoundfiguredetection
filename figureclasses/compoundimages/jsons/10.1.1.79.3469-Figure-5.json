For\nthis experiment we used the San Francisco road network.\nThe road network was partitioned with edges of level 1, and\nlevel 2. We artificially upgraded a single random path in\n20% of the lowest level areas, and set the speed for edges in\nupgraded paths higher than the average speed of the border\nedges of the area. We pre-compute fastest paths in 30%\nof the lowest level areas. Results are the average of 100\nrandom queries. We varied the average distance between\nthe starting and ending nodes. The longer the distance the\nlarger the search space. Query Length measures the distance\nof the end points in the query as a percentage of the map\ndiameter.\nIn Figure 5, we see the number of expanded nodes for the\nthree algorithms. We see that the number of nodes expanded\nby A∗ grows very rapidly for large paths. This is expected\nas there are many more possible paths to consider between\nnodes that are separated by a large number of edges. At the\nsame time we see that Hier and Adapt expand a number\nof paths that is almost constant. The reason is that both\nalgorithms limit their search to larger roads and only go into\nindividual areas at the start or end of the search. We see\nthat although Adapt has to consider all upgraded edges, it\nonly expands slightly more nodes than Hier which ignores\nthose edges.\nFigure 6 presents the travel time for the three methods.\nWe see that A∗ always gives us the fastest path. The path\nfound by Adapt is almost as good as the A∗ path, but at\n"],"Page":10,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,262,538,291],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[88,78,512,235]}
