this experiment, we investigated the applicability of various\ngraph transformation methods to enhance the weighted networks\nproduced by indirect weighting methods such as EPRI [6]. The\nrepresentative of this category was the combined data set described\nearlier in Section 4. We transformed this weighted network us-\ning the continuous h-confidence-based method, and its unweighted\nversion using three transformation methods, namely the binary h-\nconfidence-based, the p-value-based and the common neighbor-\nbased. Figure 1 shows the performance of the FunctionalFlow al-\ngorithm on the the original combined graph, its unweighted adja-\ncency matrix, and the four transformations computed above. It can\nbe seen from Figure 1(a) that continuous h-confidence has better\noverall performance in terms of precision and recall. This improve-\nment is shown much more clearly by Figure 1(b), which shows that\nthe continuous h-confidence-based transformed graph produces the\nmost accurate predictions when only the top 1000 predictions are\nconsidered, and outperforms the raw weighted network by nearly\n10% throughout. For instance, if only the top 500 predictions are\nconsidered, the accuracy of the predictions made using the raw\nweighted network is only about 70%, while that of the predictions\nmade using the continuous h-confidence-based transformations is\nover 80%. Also, for this data set, p-value-based transformation\noutperforms the raw network, though by a smaller margin than the\nh-confidence-based transformations.\n","3. Looking deeper into the results of the experiments on sev-\neral interaction networks, it can be seen that the less reli-\nable the weights assigned to the edges in the raw network,\nthe greater improvement in performance obtained by using\na continuous h-confidence-based graph transformation. For\ninstance, Figure 1(b) shows that for the combined data set,\nwhose weights are derived from gene expression data, our\nproposed transformation is able to improve predictions by\nnearly 10% throughout, which is very encouraging. On the\nother hand, Figure 3(b) shows that for the DIPCore data set,\nwhich is known to be very reliable [15, 6], the performance\nbenefits obtained by h-confidence, though significant, are of\na relatively smaller magnitude, i.e., approximately 5% through-\nout. Thus, for applications using protein interaction networks\nwhose edge weights are not available or are inappropriate,\ncontinuous h-confidence is expected to produce better perfor-\nmance than the raw weights and other transformations such\nas p-value- and common neighbor-based ones.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,662,407,690],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[86,103,395,637]}
