the above expression, one can make two important\nobservations. Firstly, each point on a given level curve con-\ntributes a certain measure to the density at that intensity.\nThe density contribution for a given intensity value at a lo-\ncation (x, y) is inversely proportional to the magnitude of\nthe gradient at that point. In other words, in regions of\nhigh intensity gradient, the area between two level curves at\nnearby intensity levels would be small, as compared to that\nin regions of lower image gradient (see Figure (1)). When\nthe gradient value at a point is zero (owing to the existence\nof a peak, a valley or a saddle point), the density at that\npoint tends to infinity. (The practical repercussions of this\nsituation are discussed later on in the paper). Secondly, the\ndensity at an intensity level can be estimated by traversing\nthe level curve(s) at that intensity and integrating the recip-\nrocal of the gradient magnitude. One can obtain an estimate\nof the density at several intensity levels (at intensity spac-\ning of h from each other) across the entire intensity range\nof the image. Such an estimate does not suffer from the bin-\nning problem, as here, an explicit relation between intensity\nand the spatial coordinates has been exploited. Therefore,\nas h becomes smaller and smaller (i.e. as the number of\nbins N increases), the density estimate becomes increas-\ningly accurate. Au contraire, a naive histogram calculation\nleaves most of the bins empty. This scenario is clearly il-\nlustrated in Figure (2), where we plot histogram envelopes\nof the face image on the left side of Figure (7), comparing\nour method to the standard histogram for 32, 64, 128, and\n256 bins, given a 100 by 100 image of 256 intensity levels.\nYet another fact to note is that we are adopting a continuous\nrepresentation of the image. This is quite unlike the stan-\ndard histogram which assumes an image to be discrete and\nflat within each pixel, and in which each pixel contributes\nto one and only one bin.\n","clean face image with its noisy rotated version by perform-\ning a brute force search (between −25 to 0 degrees) for the\nangle of rotation, so as to minimize JE and ρ, or to maxi-\nmize MI and NMI. For each angle, the values of the afore-\nmentioned four entropic measures were calculated, using\nthe standard histograms as well as our method (both with\n128 bins). A trajectory of all these quantities was then plot-\nted to visualize the nature of their variation w.r.t. the rota-\ntion (see Figure(11)). This process was repeated exactly as\nstated with the noise level raised to 0.8 and the same amount\nof blurring (see Figure (12)). From these graphs, especially\nFigure (12), one can appreciate the superior noise resistance\nof our method, due to the smoother trajectories of JE and\nMI. NMI and ρ had similar trajectories which have been\nomitted to save space. Smoothness of objective function is\nof paramount importance if brute force search is to be aban-\ndoned for more efficient search mechanisms3. Moreover,\nour method predicted the transformation parameters more\naccurately as seen in Table (1).\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[427,374,757,418],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[436,100,748,362]}
