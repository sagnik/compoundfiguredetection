The Thurstone rule does predictably well with nor-\nmally distributed noise, but interestingly, Borda performs al-\nmost identically. Among simple voting rules, Borda is al-\nmost always the best rule in all cases, except for the Con-\ndorcet model with p > 0.6. where Kemeny performs slightly\nbetter. We also point out that while Kemeny is an MLE for\nthe true ranking under the Condorcet model, it doesn\u2019t pro-\nduce the fewest expected mistakes at high levels of noise;\ninstead, Borda performs best here and this is consistent with\ntheory when choosing the winner.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[471,538,746,551],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[451,78,766,525]}
