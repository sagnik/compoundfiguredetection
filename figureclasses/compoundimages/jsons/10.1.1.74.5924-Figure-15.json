Figure 15 shows the temporal and spatial\nquality of the streamed video, and the transmission rate of\nstreaming data. The transmission rate of streaming data\ngradually decreases due to the increasing number of UDP\nsessions. The drop in transmission rate of streamed video\npeaks (by about 1\/2) when the first UDP session starts,\nand becomes less and less when later UDP sessions become\nalive. In fact, QStream(TCP) still gets a proportional share of\nthe total capacity of the wireless LAN. This is not a surprise\nas backoff procedure in the 802.11 MAC protocol help\nmaintain fairness among active nodes in a fully connected\nnetwork. Overall, spatial quality and transmission rate of\nthe streamed video gradually degrade as the number of\nUDP sessions increase, but the temporal quality oscillates\ndramatically, especially between 400s and 500s time marks.\nThis oscillation is most likely caused by nonuniformity in\nframe sizes(related to video attributes such as motion). Form\nthe perspective of a human observer, a definite degradation\nin video quality is observed when the first two UDP sessions\nare initiated. Thereafter, the degradation was not perceivable\nto the human observer. This shows that quality degradations\nperceived by human users are not always correlated to the\nobjective measures like data transmission rate and further\ndemonstrate the importance of perceptual evaluation for\nadaptive media applications, which can be easily supported\nby TWINE.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":15,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[308,196,537,208],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[108,73,739,195]}
