This is a function of our heartbeat period (2\nseconds), and appears independent of the number of fail-\nures. The system captures the majority of the data with\nan average result latency of 4.5 seconds. Our branching\nfactor of 16 results in a tree of height 4, which is the path\nlength when there are no failures. Even during 40% fail-\nures, the majority of tuples can route around failures with\nthree extra overlay hops. The steady-state network load\nis 12.5 Mbps (3.4 Mbps of which is heartbeat overhead).\nAs a point of comparison, the same experiment without\naggregation incurred twice the network load (26 Mbps).\nFinally, while not precisely churn, a query should still\nbe resilient to nodes cycling between reachable and un-\nreachable states. Figure 15 shows results where we ran-\ndomly disconnect 10% of the nodes. Then, every 10 sec-\nonds, we reconnect 5% of the failed nodes and fail an ad-\nditional, random 5%. Mortar always reconnects all live\nnodes before the 10 seconds are up. Result latency, net-\nwork load, and tuple path length are similar to that seen\nin the rolling failures experiment.\n"],"Page":11,"Number":14,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,430,412,461],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[110,102,401,411]}
