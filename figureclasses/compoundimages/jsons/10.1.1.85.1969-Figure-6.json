Figure \n4 shows the two lighting variations from the viewpoint of \none of the cameras. Color constancy was evaluated using one \nof the two lighting configurations. Light transport constancy \nwas evaluated by first computing a new image as the ratio of \nthe two illumination conditions, as given in equation (4). \nThis is mathematically equivalent to evaluating the rank con-\nstraint. The resulting ratio image is shown in Figure 5. Note \nthat neither the specular highlights nor any other view de-\npendant effect are visible in the ratio image.  \nStandard stereo matching was applied to the stereo pairs \narising from both color constancy and light transport con-\nstancy using a Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD) metric. \nSince we are interested in the performance of a local match-\ning operator, we use a winner-takes-all approach and simply \naccept the minimum SAD disparity as correct, rather than \napplying a global regularization method.  \nFigure 6 shows the stereo results from each method. \nThe left column is derived from color constancy, while the \nright column is from light transport constancy. The first row \nshows the disparity map computed by each method.  Depth is \ncoded such that white pixels indicate depths closer to the \ncamera. The second row shows the same data along a single \nscan-line as scaled disparity values. In both visualizations, it \nis clear that our new method has superior results. Note the \ngarbled depth values in the case of color constancy.  \nIn the third row of Figure 6, we investigate the reason \nthat our method performs well by plotting the matching pro-\nfile for a single pixel. Note that color constancy has no clear \nglobal minimum, while our method has a very clear mini-\nmum at the correct disparity. This presumably leads to much \nbetter depth estimates.  \nIn order to validate that existing stereo methods can be \nadapted to handle non-Lambertian objects, we tested the \nsame two sets of stereo pairs with a stereo implementation \navailable on the web [7]. This implementation happens to be \nbased on graph cuts [10], allowing us to further verify that no \nundesirable artifacts are caused by integration with a global \nregularization method. Since we have computed a ratio im-\nage to use for matching, absolutely no modification to the \nexisting code was required.
