We identify 2.47 million threads in to-\ntal. In Figure 5.1, we plot the distribution for the number\nof messages in each thread. On average, each thread con-\nsists of 4.9 messages. Of the 2.47 million identified threads,\n87.1% are static, meaning that neither of the two users\nparticipating in the thread changes the associated MSC,\nthroughout the thread. This also implies that for 87.1%\nof all the threads, thread mobility can be handled at the\nBTS\/BTC (base station\/base station controller) level. We\nfurther study the remaining 12.9% of the identified threads,\nwhich are roaming threads. In roaming threads, at least one\nuser switches to another MSC during the thread duration.\nFigure 5.2 plots the distribution for the number of handoffs\nthat occurred during the lifetime of roaming threads. The\nfigure shows that more than half of the roaming threads,\ni.e., 61.1%, experience only one handoff at the MSC level.\nNext, we model the thread duration against simple analyt-\nical distributions. Figure 7 gives the empirical CDF as well\nas the CDFs fitted by analytical distributions. The Weibull\nmodel turns out to give the minimum deviation, followed by\nthe Lognormal model. On average the thread duration is 8\n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[140,280,339,294],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[83,76,398,263]}
