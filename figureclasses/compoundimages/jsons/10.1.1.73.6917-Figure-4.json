However, for one node\n(planet2.cs.rochester.edu) the bandwidth is less\nthan 400Kbps 4. We then create a DAG and push\nthe \fle to all the nodes. We repeat the experi-\nment for 20 times and show the CDF of the band-\nwidth in Figure 4(a). The \fgure shows that most\nof the time, we can achieve a bandwidth between\n400Kbps and 600Kbps, and the average is about\n490Kbps. Figure 4(b) shows the result when we remove\nplanet2.cs.rochester.edu. We can see most of the\ntime the bandwidth is between 900Kbps and 1.3Mbps,\nand the average is about 1.1Mbps. Since all the nodes\nare receiving the data at the same time, this means\non average we can achieve an e\u000Bective aggregate band-\nwidth of about 22Mbps, which is about 7 times the\nlargest bandwidth that our local node can provide to\nan individual node (planetlab2.cs.uiuc.edu). The\nabove experiments allowed each node to have a maxi-\nmum of 3 parents (the actual number of parents may\nbe smaller). Figure 4(b) also shows the result for 20\nnodes when each node has at most 1 parent (i.e. trees).\nWe can see that about 20% of the time, the bandwidth\nis less than 700Kbps, and on average the bandwidth\nis about 10% smaller than the DAG case.
