with longer file lengths. Specifically, for audio ob-\njects, as shown in Figure 1(a), more than 70% of sessions in\nthe business user workload request objects with a file length\nbetween 200\u2013400 seconds, the typical duration of a pop song;\nin contrast, for home users, more than 50% of audio sessions\nrequest files with a length around 30 seconds, most of which\nare music preview samples.\nFigure 1(b) and Figure 2(b) further compare user play-\nback durations of on-demand audio\/video sessions in the\nhome and business user workloads. As shown in Figure 1(b),\nfor more than half of on-demand audio sessions in the busi-\nness user workload, the user playback duration is about 200\u2013\n400 seconds, corresponding to the length of a typical pop\nsong as in Figure 1(a). Figures 1(c) and 2(c) show the play-\nback duration of live audio\/video sessions in the home and\nbusiness user workloads. From these figures, we can see that\nfor both live and on-demand audio\/video sessions, the play-\nback duration of business users is much longer than that of\nhome users (note that the x-axis is in log scale).\nThe above results indicate that business users tend to lis-\nten more audio on the Internet and tend to stick to the\nmedia content being played longer than home users. How-\never, looking into the URLs and the Referer headers of\nRTSP commands in the trace, we found that the major-\nity of streaming media accessed by home users and business\nusers are both from news and entertainment sites. Thus, the\ndifferent access pattern of business users is not due to the\naccesses of business related media content, but rather due to\nthe working environments of business users\u2014audio is more\npreferred possibly because it attracts less attention when\nthey are working, and the long playback duration might be\nbecause their business work prevents them from frequently\nchanging media programs.\n","Fast Cache delivers a media object to a client faster than\nthe playing speed by over-utilizing the bandwidth and CPU\nresources. However, streaming a media object at a rate\nhigher than its encoding rate is only possible when the\navailable bandwidth between a client and its server is large\nenough. Intuitively, when a media object is streamed at its\nencoding rate, the higher the average bandwidth between a\nclient and its server over its encoding rate, the lower possi-\nbility at which performance degradation occurs during the\nplayback. To understand whether Fast Cache performs bet-\nter than normal TCP-based streaming when the average\nbandwidth between a client and its server is large enough,\nwe plot the CDF of rebuffering ratio for Fast Cache based\nstreaming sessions and normal TCP-based streaming ses-\nsions in the home user workload in which the media encoding\nrate of each stream is 200\u2013320 Kbps and the client adver-\ntised bandwidth (extracted from the Bandwidth header) is\nat least 500 Kbps greater than the media encoding rate, as\nshown in Figure 12. Compared with Figure 7(a), the two\ncurves in Figure 12 are very close, which means that, al-\nthough temporary network congestion may occur from time\nto time, a small play-out buffer performs well enough to\nsmooth out bandwidth fluctuation during streaming, when\nthe average bandwidth is large enough. Thus, aggressively\nover-utilizing the server and Internet resources is neither\nperformance-effective nor cost-efficient under a high band-\nwidth condition. The higher speed at which Fast Cache can\nstream a media object, the lower necessity is this speed for\na client. Furthermore, even if no extra traffic generated (as-\n","To enable stream switch, the media object must be en-\ncoded with multiple bit rates (MBR): the encoder generates\nmultiple streams with different bit rates for the same media\ncontent, and encapsulates all these streams together.\nFigures 13(a), 13(b), 13(c) and Figures 13(d), 13(e), 13(f)\nshow the distribution of the number of streams encoded in\non-demand and live media objects in the home user and\nbusiness user workloads, respectively. For video objects, we\nshow the number of audio streams and video streams in a\nfile separately (Figures 13(b), 13(c) for on-demand objects\nand Figures 13(e), 13(f) for live objects). Because there are\nonly a small amount of live video objects in the business\nuser workload, we do not present them in Figures 13(e),\n13(f). These figures show that about 42% of the on-demand\nvideo objects in the home user workload are encoded with\nat least two video streams. The number of video streams in\nvideo objects is up to 12, and the number of video and audio\nstreams together in a video object is up to 20. The num-\nber of streams in live audio objects is relatively small, but\nthere are still 13% and 28% of the objects in home user and\nbusiness user workloads encoded with at least two streams,\nrespectively. These results indicate that the MBR encoding\ntechnique has been widely used in media authoring, which\nenables the rate adaptation\u2014dynamically switching among\nstreams based on the available bandwidth.\nThe stream switch in RTSP protocols works as follows\n(stream switch in MMS has a similar procedure).
