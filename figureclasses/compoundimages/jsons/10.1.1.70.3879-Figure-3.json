{"Caption":"Figure 3: Segmentation results for several methods applied to a natural image. For methods other than affinity propagation, many parameter settings were tried and the best segmenta- tion selected. The histograms show the percentile in score achieved by affinity propagation compared to 1000 runs of greedy EM, for different random training sets. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We next analyzed the more natural 192 × 192 image shown in Fig. 3. Since there is no\nnatural background color, we use mean-squared pixel differences in HSV color space to\nmeasure similarity between the 24× 24 patches:\n","We cut the image in Fig. 3 into an 8 × 8 grid of non-overlapping 24 × 24 patches and\nclustered them into K = 6 classes using affinity propagation (both forms), greedy EM\nin our model, spectral clustering (using a normalized L-matrix based on a set of 29 × 29\noverlapping patches), and mixtures of Gaussians2. For greedy EM, the affinity propagation\nalgorithms, and mixtures of Gaussians, we then choose all possible 24 × 24 overlapping\npatches and calculated the likelihoods of them given each of the 6 cluster centers, classify-\ning each patch according to its maximum likelihood.\n","Fig. 3 shows the segmentations for the various methods, where the central pixel of each\npatch is colored according to its class. Again, affinity propagation achieves a solution that\nis near-best compared to one thousand runs of greedy EM.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,419,675,479],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[173,97,678,414]}
