{"Caption":"Figure 8: Impact of scan errors on survival probability. Left figure shows aggregate survival probability for all drives after first scan error. Middle figure breaks down survival probability per drive ages in months. Right figure breaks down drives by their number of scan errors. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["From Figure 8 we see a drastic and quick decrease in\nsurvival probability after the first scan error (left graph).\nA little over 70% of the drives survive the first 8 months\nafter their first scan error. The dashed lines represent the\n95% confidence interval. The middle plot in Figure 8\nseparates the population in four age groups (in months),\nand shows an effect that is not visible in the AFR plots. It\nappears that scan errors affect the survival probability of\nyoung drives more dramatically very soon after the first\nscan error occurs, but after the first month the curve flat-\ntens out. Older drives, however, continue to see a steady\ndecline in survival probability throughout the 8-month\nperiod. This behavior could be another manifestation of\ninfant mortality phenomenon. The right graph in figure 8\nlooks at the effect of multiple scan errors. While drives\nwith one error are more likely to fail than those with\nnone, drives with multiple errors fail even more quickly.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,580,750,625],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[101,388,744,573]}
