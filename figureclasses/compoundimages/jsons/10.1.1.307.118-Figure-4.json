On each panel, results on the left are for UCT and AOT\nusing the base random policy, while results on the right are\nfor the base optimistic policy that assumes that all edges of\nunknown status are traversable. The points for UCT corre-\nspond to running 10, 50, 100, 500, 1k, 5k, 10k and 50k itera-\ntions (rollouts), resulting in the times shown. The points for\nAOT, correspond to running 10, 50, 100, 500, 1k, 5k, 10k it-\nerations (expansions). Points that time out are not displayed.\nThe curves show that AOT performs better than UCT except\nup to the time window of 1 second in the instance 20-7 for\nthe random base policy. We have computed the curves for\nthe 20 instances and the pattern is similar (but not shown for\nlack of space). A comprehensive view of the results is shown\nin Table 1. As a reference, we include also the results for\ntwo specialized implementations of UCT, UCTB and UCTO\n(Eyerich, Keller, and Helmert 2010), that take advantage of\nthe specific MDP structure of the CTP, use a more informed\nbase policy, and actually solve a slightly simpler version of\nthe problem where the given CTP is solvable.
