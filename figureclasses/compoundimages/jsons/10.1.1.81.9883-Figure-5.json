Specifically, we\ninvestigate the impact of the wake-up interval of the high-power\nradio on the contact discovery performance. We consider two met-\nrics: (1) contact discovery ratio, which is the discovered contact\ntime divided by the total contact time that the high-power radio\ncould have discovered when using CAM, and (2) energy efficiency,\nwhich is the average amount of discovered contact time per unit\nenergy used. In other words, we measure how much energy the\nsystem spends to find a certain amount of message transfer time\u2014\nthe more transfer time discovered per joule of energy, the higher\nthe efficiency is.\nWe use the ns-2 simulator with the following parameters. We use\n802.11 MAC layer for both interfaces at different channels. Also,\nboth interfaces set the beacon period to 2 seconds and the beacon\nwindow to 300ms. Each simulation runs for 50 hours of simulated\ntime and each point of our graphs represents the average of ten\nruns. To simulate node movement, we use the Random-Waypoint\n(RWP) [15] mobility model. For the experiment we use the energy\nconsumption of an 802.11 and a CC1000 radio as shown in Table 1.\nFor the low-power radio, the radio range and the data rate are 100m\nand 76.8Kb\/s, respectively. For the high-power radio, the radio\nrange and the data rate are 250m and 2Mb\/s, respectively.\nIn Figure 5, we show the impact of the wake-up interval of the\nhigh-power radio on the performance of contact discovery as the in-\nterval varies from 2 to 1024 seconds to show how it trades between\nenergy savings and contact discovery performance. The wake-up\ninterval of the low-power radio is set to 2 seconds for both SPSM\nand GPSM.\nFigure 5(a) shows that the contact discovery ratio of PSM de-\ncreases from 100% to below 10% as the wake-up interval increases.\nOn the other hand, GPSM discovers more than 37% of contacts for\nall wake-up intervals because the low-power radio assists the dis-\ncovery. In addition, its discovery ratio is always more than that of\nSPSM because of the high-power radio.\nFigure 5(b) shows that the energy efficiency of GPSM and PSM\nincreases and then decreases as the wake-up interval decreases. Us-\ning smaller wake-up intervals than the peak of the graph wastes en-\nergy without discovering many more contacts.
