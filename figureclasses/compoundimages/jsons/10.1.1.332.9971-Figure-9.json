Note that for the same value of β a greater time of decay ρ gives us smoother functions and higher value of ranks. However, it does not change the order of the most authoritative sources.

Figure 9 shows the evolution of the rank\nover a period of 55 days of the top four sources in the cate-\ngory \u201CWorld\u201D. The two plot are obtained choosing β = 0.5\nand for two choices of the half-life decay time, that is ρ = 24\nand 48 hours. RedNova [27] results the most authoritative\nsource, followed by Yahoo!
