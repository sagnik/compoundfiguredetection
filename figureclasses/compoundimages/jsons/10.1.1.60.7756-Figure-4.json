On\nthe other hand, the top 1% of loyal gamers return to play\nhundreds of times (hence the logarithmic scale). It appears\nthat the majority of clients have very little loyalty to pub-\nlic servers, and only a small fraction have grown strongly\nattached.

As expected, the per-continent\nload fluctuations and variance are similar to those found in\nthe two regional web sites. The figure also shows that usage\nof both applications are highly synchronized when broken\ndown into geographic regions.
