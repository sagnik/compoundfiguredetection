first experiment investigates the efficacy of the mechanisms\nemployed by the cataclysm sentry for revenue maximization and\nto provide class-based differentiation to requests during overloads.\nThe cataclysm provisioning was kept turned off in this experiment.\nWe constructed a replicated Web server consisting of three Apache\nservers. This application supported three classes of requests\u2014Gold,\nSilver and Bronze in decreasing order of revenue. The class of a re-\nquest could be uniquely determined from its URL. The delay values\nfor the three classes were fixed at 0, 50, and 100 msec, respectively.\nThe minimum sustainable requests rates desired by all three classes\nwere chosen to be 0.\nThe workload consisted of requests for a set of PHP scripts. The\ncapacity of each Apache server for this workload (i.e., the request\narrival rate for which the 95th percentile response time of the re-\nquests was below the response time target) was determined offline\nand was found to be nearly 60 requests\/sec. Figure 3(a) shows\nthe workload used in this experiment. Nearly all the requests ar-\n","riving till t=130 sec were admitted by the sentry. Between t=130\nsec and t=195 sec, the Bronze requests were dropped almost ex-\nclusively. At t=195 sec the arrival rate of Silver requests shot up\nand reached nearly 120 requests\/sec. The admission rate of Bronze\nrequests dropped to almost zero to admit as many Silver requests\nas possible. At t=210 sec, the arrival rate of Gold requests shot\nup to 200 requests\/sec. The sentry totally suppressed all arriving\nBronze and Silver requests now and let in only Gold requests as\nlong as the increased arrival rate of Gold requests persisted. Fig-\nure 3(c) is an alternate representation of the system behavior in this\nexperiment and depicts the variation of the fraction of requests of\nthe three classes that were admitted. Figure 3(d) depicts the perfor-\nmance of admitted requests.
