Figure 2 (middle) shows the\npenetration as a function of these parameters. Only a small range\nof δ values is shown because higher and lower δ results in signifi-\ncantly reduced penetration. The plots show that, although the opti-\nmal choice of β and δ depends upon specific environmental factors,\nthe curves exhibit a regular shape. Based on these and other results,\nwe select default values of β = 0.5 and δ = 0.08. Although not\noptimal in every setting, our sensitivity analysis in Section 7.2.6\nshows that these settings exhibit good behavior even as we vary the\ndifferent model parameters.\n","It is insightful to view the tree structure and its induced win-\nprobability distribution resulting from the Pachira lottree. For our\ndefault parameters, the lottree grows in average up to depth of 25.\nFigure 2 (right) shows the distribution of nodes and win proba-\nbilities relative to the different levels of the tree (the root level is\n0). These CDFs show that Pachira generates a bell-shaped dis-\ntribution in which the majority of the nodes are contained in the\nmiddle levels. Relative to the distribution of nodes, the distribution\nof win probability is shifted slightly towards the higher levels, re-\nflecting the effect of the solicitation incentive that rewards nodes\nwith many descendents. The figure shows that our default para-\nmeters of β = 0.5 and δ = 0.08 strike a subtle balance between\nfairness (probability curve follows the node distribution curve) and\nsolicitation incentive (left shift of the probability curve).\n","over a two-dimensional parameter space in which each random\nsample point may experience variance, finding optimal values for β\nand δ given a set of configuration parameters is a computationally\nintensive task. For this reason, we have conducted our sensitiv-\nity analysis with a reduced population size of 106. Resorting to\nthis smaller population is justified by Figure 2 (left). Our imple-\nmentation of the search procedure itself is based on a hill-climbing\nalgorithm with decreasing step-size.\nA few examples of our sensitivity results are shown in Figure 4,\nand a summary of our main results is presented in Table 2.
