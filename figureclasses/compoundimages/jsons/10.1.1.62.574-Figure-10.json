As a re-\nsult, a request may have to wait for a longer time to be\nserved when a burst of requests arrive at the server. We\ndefine the server response time of a RTSP\/MMS request\nto be the duration from the time instant when a server re-\nceives the first command from a client, to the time instant\nwhen the server sends its reply. Since our workloads are\ncollected by Gigascope at a site very close to end users, the\ntimestamp of a captured packet can be regarded as the time\ninstant when the client sends or receives that packet. We\nuse the timestamps of TCP handshake packets to estimate\nthe packet round trip time (RTT), and then compute the\nserver response time.\nFigure 10(a) shows the distribution of the server response\ntime for streaming requests served by third-party media ser-\nvices. We compare the response time of requests to servers\nwith and without running Fast Cache. For servers running\nFast Cache, about 43% of the requests have a response time\nlonger than 0.1 second, while for servers not running Fast\nCache, only about 9% of the requests have a response time\nlonger than 0.1 second. Figure 10(b) shows the correspond-\ning distribution of the server response time for streaming\nrequests served by self-hosting media services. For servers\nrunning Fast Cache, about 21% of the requests have a re-\nsponse time longer than 0.1 second, while for servers not\nrunning Fast Cache, only about 5% of the requests have a\nresponse time longer than 0.1 second. These results indi-\ncate that the response time on servers running Fast Cache\nis statistically longer than that on servers not running Fast\nCache. We also observe that the response time of the third-\nparty hosting service is larger than that of the self-hosting\nservice.
