Figure 6(a) plots the size of the relevant set for a sample query on the\nname \u2018T. Lee\u2019 for arXiv and \u2018M. Yamashita\u2019 for BioBase. The growth rate for the arXiv\nquery is moderate. The number of references with name \u2018T. Lee\u2019 is 7, which is the number\nof relevant references at depth 0, and the size grows to 7,500 by depth 7. In contrast, for\nBioBase the plots clearly demonstrate the exponential growth of the relevant references\n","Next, in Figure 6(b), we observe how the relational clustering algorithm RC-ER scales\nwith increasing number of references in the relevant set. All execution times are reported\non a Dell Precision 870 server with 3.2GHz Intel Xeon processor and 3GB of memory. The\nplot shows that the algorithm scales well with increasing references, but the gradient is\ndifferent for the two datasets. This is mainly due to the difference in the average number of\nreferences per hyper-edge. This suggests that for arXiv, RC-ER is capable of handling the\nrelevant sets generated using unconstrained expansion. But for BioBase, it would require\nup to 600 secs for 40,000 references, and up to 900 secs for 65,000. So it is clearly not\npossible to use RC-ER with unconstrained expansion for query-time resolution in BioBase\neven for depth 3.\n"],"Page":22,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[123,345,725,362],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[150,139,695,325]}
