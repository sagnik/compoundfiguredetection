{"Caption":"Figure 3: Modelselection and evaluation. Left subplots: Selection of hyperparameter ξ of the iCSP method. For each subject, a cross-validation was performed for different values of ξ on the training data (session imag_move), see thin black line, and the ξ resulting in minimum error was chosen (circle). For the same values of ξ the iCSP filters + LDA classifier trained on imag_move were applied to calculate the test error on data from imag_lett (thick colorful line). Right plot: Test error in all four recordings for classical CSP and the proposed iCSP (with model parameter ξ chosen by cross-validation on the training set as described in Section 4).

the test error on data from imag_lett. Fig. 3 (left plots) shows the result of this procedure. The\nshape of the cross-validation error on the training set and the test error is very similar. Accordingly,\nthe selection of values for parameter ξ is successful. For subject zq ξ = 0 was chosen, i.e. classical\nCSP. The case for subject zk shows that the selection of ξ may be a delicate issue. For larges val-\nues of ξ cross-validation error and test error differ dramatically. A choice of ξ > 0.5 would result\nin bad performance of iCSP, while this effect could have not been predicted so severely from the\ncross-validation of the training set.\n","A limitation of our method is that variations need to be characterized in advance (by estimating an\nappropriate covariance matrix). At the same time this is also a strength of our method as neuro-\nphysiological prior knowledge about possible sources of non-stationarity is available and can thus\nbe taken into account in a controlled manner. Also the selection of hyperparameter ξ needs more\ninvestigation, cf. the case of subject zk in Fig. 3. One strategy to pursue is to update the covariance\nmatrix Ξ online with incoming test data. (Note that no label information is needed.) Online learning\n(learning algorithms for adaptation within a BCI session) could also be used to further stabilize the\nsystem against unforeseen changes. It remains to future research to explore this interesting direction.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,315,700,415],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[148,113,701,306]}
