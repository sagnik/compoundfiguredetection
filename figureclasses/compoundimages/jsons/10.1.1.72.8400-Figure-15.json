{"Caption":"Figure 15:    We investigate the effect of the queue length limit, when mixing equiprobable requests from clients with 10T and T3 links for a 512MB file at different loads. As the queue length limit increases, the disk throughput also grows leading to higher miss ratio. Eventually, the disk bandwidth becomes bottleneck which makes the server network throughput to drop.

On the other hand, large queue lengths\ncan increase the throughput of the system by keeping\neach client's network path fully pipelined.
