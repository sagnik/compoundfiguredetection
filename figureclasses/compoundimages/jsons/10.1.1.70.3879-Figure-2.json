{"Caption":"Figure 2: Segmentation of non-aligned gray-scale characters. Patches clustered by affinity propagation and K-medoids are colored according to classification (centers shown below solutions). Affinity propagation achieves a near-best score compared to 1000 runs of K- medoids. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We present results for segmenting two image types. First, as a toy example, we segment\nan image containing many noisy examples of the letters \u2018N\u2019 \u2018I\u2019 \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 (see Fig. 2).\nThe original image is gray-scale with resolution 216 × 240 and intensities ranging from 0\n","We cut the image in Fig. 2 into a 9×10 grid of non-overlapping 24×24 patches, computed\nthe pair-wise likelihoods, and clustered them into K = 4 classes using the greedy EM\nalgorithm (randomly chosen initial exemplars) and affinity propagation. (Max-product and\nsum-product affinity propagation yielded identical results.) We then took a much larger set\nof overlapping patches, classified them into the 4 categories, and then colored each pixel in\nthe image according to the most frequent class for the pixel. The results are shown in Fig. 2.\nWhile affinity propagation is deterministic, the EM algorithm depends on initialization. So,\nwe ran the EM algorithm 1000 times and in Fig. 2 we plot the cumulative distribution of\nthe logP scores obtained by EM. The score for affinity propagation is also shown, and\nachieves near-best performance (98th percentile).\n"],"Page":5,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,252,675,312],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[198,99,652,236]}
