In SybilGuard,\neach node infers the needed length of the routes using the sampling\ntechnique described in Section 4.7. Using this technique, a node A\nfirst performs a short random walk ending at some node B. Then A\nand B both perform random routes to determine how long the routes\nneed to be in order to intersect. Such estimation would be entirely\naccurate if (i) B were chosen uniformly randomly from all nodes in\nthe system; and (ii) the number of samples were infinite. In practice,\nhowever, neither condition holds.\nTo gain insight into the impact of B not actually being a uniformly\nrandom node, Figure 10 depicts the distribution of the number of\nhops before intersection, comparing the case when B is chosen\nuniformly at random to the case when B is chosen using a 3-hop\nrandom walk from A. As the figure shows, the two distributions\nare quite similar. This will help to explain later the small impact\nof B not being uniformly random. Based on the distribution when\nB is chosen uniformly at random, we obtain an accurate w of 1906\nneeded for 95% of the pairs to intersect. This value of 1906 will be\nused as a comparison with SybilGuard\u2019s estimated w.\nTo understand the error introduced by having only a finite number\nof samples, we study how the estimated w fluctuates and approaches\n1906 as a node takes more and more samples. This experiment is\nrepeated from multiple different nodes. In all cases, we observe that\nthe estimated w always falls within 1906± 300 after 30 samples.\nWhile after 100 samples, the estimated w always falls within 1906±\n150. These results show that the estimated w is accurate enough\neven after a small number of samples. Even with only 30 samples\nand a worst case estimated w of 1606, Figure 9 still shows a close-to-\n100% intersection probability when using redundancy. On the other\nhand, because taking each sample only involves a 3-hop random\nwalk and the transfer of a witness table, the overhead is quite small.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[140,240,702,253],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[117,82,725,228]}
