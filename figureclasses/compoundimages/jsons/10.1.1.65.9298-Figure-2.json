{"Caption":"Figure 2: AT-cut crystal clock skew over two tem- perature ranges. Full operational range is shown above, with indicated zoomed-in area below. On the zoomed graph, the temperature and skew ranges found in Figure 5(a) are shown. As skews are rela- tive, the curves have been shifted vertically so that skew is zero at the minimum observed temperature.

Exactly how depends on\ntradeoffs made during manufacture. The figure shows an\nAT-cut crystal common for PCs, whose skew is defined by a\ncubic function. BT-cut is more common for sub-megahertz\ncrystals and is defined by a quadratic. The angle of cut al-\nters the temperature response and some options are shown.\nIt can be seen that improving accuracy in the temperature\nrange between the two turning points degrades performance\noutside these values. Over the range of temperatures en-\ncountered in our experiments, skew response to temperature\nis almost linear, so for simplicity we will treat it as such.\nThe linear offset fit shown in Figure 1 matches almost per-\nfectly, excluding noise. This indicates that although temper-\n","but is over compensating; another is that the temperature\ncurve for the crystal is different from Figure 2. In both cases\nthere is a clear correlation between temperature and skew,\ndespite only a modest temperature change.\nWhile the CPU is under load, there is increased noise\npresent in the results. This could be due to increased latency\non the network, or more likely because the CPU is so busy,\nthe operating system sometimes allocates a quantum to the\nTor process in between adding a timestamp to a packet and\ndispatching it. However, note that the minimum latency is\nunchanged (and is often reached) so the linear programming\nalgorithm still performs well. Were the minimum to change,\nthen a step in the graph would be expected, rather than the\nsmooth curve apparent.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,644,772,744],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,84,769,616]}
