In addition to the bottom-\nup (BU) and the top-down (TD) algorithms described in\nthe paper, for benchmarking we also made up an exhaustive\nalgorithm (EX). To compute the p-skyline on a data set,\nwithout any pruning techniques, EX has to compute the\nskyline probability for each uncertain object. Therefore, it\nis insensitive to the change of probability threshold.\nBoth BU and TD are much faster than EX. The results\nclearly indicate that the pruning techniques in those two\nmethods significantly save the cost of computing the exact\nskyline probabilities of many instances and objects.\nComputing skylines on anti-correlated data sets is much\nmore challenging. In the rest of this section, we focus on\nanalyzing in detail the performance of BU and TD on anti-\ncorrelated data sets.\nFigure 13 compares BU and TD with respect to dimen-\nsionality and cardinality. Both algorithms follow similar\ntrends. The runtime of both algorithms increases when the\ndimensionality increases from 2 to 6, but decreases after-\nward. On the one hand, the cost of dominance testing be-\ntween two instances, which is the basic operation in both\nalgorithms, increases as the dimensionality increases. On\nthe other hand, the average number of possible dominat-\ning objects for an uncertain object decreases since the data\nset becomes sparser when the dimensionality increases. The\ntrend of runtime reflects the compromise of the two factors.\nThe higher the dimensionality, the sparser the data set.\nThe larger the cardinality, the denser the data set. Fig-\nure 13 indicates that TD performs better when the data set\nis sparser. In sparse data set, the subset instances of un-\ncertain objects may have a smaller chance to overlap, and\na better chance to be pruned by some subset instances of\nother objects. Thus, TD has better performance. On the\nother hand, in dense data sets, the skyline probability of\nan instance may improve the bounds of the probabilities of\nmore other instances and objects, and BU performs better.\n"],"Page":11,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[447,597,763,610],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[442,458,772,580]}
