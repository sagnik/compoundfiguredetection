The same\nis true in Figure 7(b) with respect to the ALL curve.\nThis indicates, that given appropriate chunksizes, a CAS-\nbased policy can outperform compression applied to a\nnon-CAS-based policy.\n","To better understand the effect of chunksize, we an-\nalyzed the deployment data for all three storage poli-\ncies with and without compression under several differ-\nent chunksizes. The results are shown in Figure 7.\n","Exposing redundancy outweighs meta-data over-\nhead. Figure 8 shows the ratio of meta-data (keyring\nsize) to the size of the data. We observe that this ratio is\nas high as 80% for ALL, and 35% for IP at 4KB chunk-\nsize without compression and even higher after compres-\nsion is applied to the basic data. Yet, from Figure 7(b),\nwe observe from the IP and ALL curves that reducing\nchunksize always yields a reduction in storage require-\nments. This indicates that the gains through CAS-based\nredundancy elimination far exceed the additional meta-\ndata overhead incurred from smaller chunksize.\n","All three effects of chunksize can be observed in\nthis Ô¨Ågure. For example, Figure 7(a), which ignores\nthe increased meta-data required for smaller chunksizes,\nclearly indicates that smaller chunksizes expose more re-\ndundancy. These gains for small chunk sizes, however,\nare erased when the meta-data cost is introduced to the\nstorage requirements in Figure 7(b). Finally, the reduced\nopportunities for compression due to smaller chunksize\ncan be observed in Figure 7(b) by comparing the IP and\nIP(gzip) or ALL and ALL(gzip) curves.\n","The picture changes slightly with the introduction of\ntraditional compression. The IP(gzip) and ALL(gzip)\ncurves of Figure 7(b) indicate that the smallest chunk-\nsize is not optimal. In fact, we see from Figure 8 that\nthe meta-data volume becomes comparable to the data\nvolume at small chunksizes.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[253,607,594,621],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[137,384,697,599]}
