{"Caption":"Figure 2: 2AFC speed discrimination experiment. a) Two patches of drifting gratings were displayed simultaneously (motion without movement). The subject was asked to fixate the center cross and decide after the presentation which of the two gratings was moving faster. b) A typical psychometric curve obtained under such paradigm. The dots represent the empirical probability that the subject perceived stimulus2 moving faster than stimulus1. The speed of stimulus1 was fixed while v 2 is varied. The point of subjective equality, v match , is the value of v2 for which Pcum = 0.5. The threshold velocity v thresh is the velocity for which Pcum = 0.875.
