{"Caption":"Figure 3: The mean squared error of four algorithms with a Swiss Roll manifold using a varying number of neighbors k. When k > 57, neighbor paths cut across the manifold. Isomap is more robust to this problem than other algorithms, but HLLE and Manifold Sculpting still yield better results. Results are shown on a logarithmic scale. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We created a Swiss Roll with 2000 data points and reduced the dimensionality to 2 with each of four\nalgorithms. Next we tested how well these results align with the expected values by measuring the\nmean squared distance from each point to its expected value. (See Figure 3.) We rotated, scaled,\nand translated the values as required to obtain the minimum possible error measurement for each\nalgorithm. These results are consistent with a qualitative assessment of Figure 1. Results are shown\nwith a varying number of neighbors k. In this example, when k = 57, local neighborhoods begin\nto cut across the manifold. Isomap is more robust to this problem than other algorithms, but HLLE\nand Manifold Sculpting still yield better results.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,358,700,418],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[155,100,702,337]}
