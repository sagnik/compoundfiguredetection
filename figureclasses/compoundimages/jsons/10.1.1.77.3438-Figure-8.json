the research and lessons about tsunami starts to increase\nagain. The same pattern is discovered in reports on personal\nexperiences, which is probably because survivors had come\nback to their home country around that time. Both themes\ndrop sharply around Jan. 17. After Jan. 22, all 5 themes\nretain a low strength level, indicating the event was receiving\ndiminishing attention. The normalized strengths of themes\nin the CNN data show similar patterns.\nIn Figure 8, we show the absolute and normalized strengths\nof the \fve trans-collection themes over time in Xinghua\nNews (W = 10). We see that, in the \frst week beginning\nDec. 25th 2004, all 5 themes are increasing rapidly, but they\nall begin to decay around Jan. 10th except for stories and\nreports at the scene, which increases again after a roughly\n10-day period of mild decreasing. The theme about death\nstatistics begins to decay all the time after Jan. 16. Both\naids from China and the research and lessons about tsunami\npresent a second rise in late January, although not as sig-\nni\fcant as the \frst one. In the normalized strength plot, it\nis easy to see that before Jan 3rd, the dominating theme is\ntheme 5. In the next 10 days, aid from the world is most\nsigni\fcant. In the following 20 days, \\on-scene stories\" is\nthe dominating theme, although its absolute strength is de-\ncreasing for most of the time. In the last time period when\nthe overall coverage of the topic had signi\fcantly decreased,\nAids from China is relatively stronger than other themes.\nComparing CNN and Xinhua, we see the life cycles of the\ncorrelated themes in the two data sets exhibit comparable\npatterns but with some di\u000Berences.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,635,771,664],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[505,291,707,620]}
