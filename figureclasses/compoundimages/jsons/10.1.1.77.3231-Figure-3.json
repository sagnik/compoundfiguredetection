Therefore, using byte-by-byte comparison with the orig-\ninally prepared binary content, we can distinguish polluted chunks\nfrom other clean chunks in the traces for both Brooklyn and Hong\nKong peers. In the remaining part of this section, we describe re-\nsults in terms of the numbers of polluted chunks observed.\nIn Figure 3, we plot the chunk download rate and upload rate\nof the Brooklyn peer, which is the initial pollution target. These\nvideo chunks are divided into polluted chunks and normal chunks.\nBefore launching the pollution attack at t = 34 minutes, the chunk\ndownload rate is 5.92 chunk\/sec, matching the video playback bit\nrate 5.92 × 7220 × 8 = 342 kbps. In addition, all the down-\nloaded chunks are clean chunks. After the pollution is launched, the\nBrooklyn peer receives most of the video chunks from the polluter.\nOnly sporadically, the Brooklyn peer downloads clean chunks from\nother peers. It also starts to upload these polluted chunks to multi-\nple other PPLive peers.\nThe Hong Kong peer is far away from and is not in the peer lists\n"],"Page":3,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[263,362,582,377],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[79,95,760,346]}
