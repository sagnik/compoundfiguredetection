We observe that the initially highly irregular concast tree\nconverges to a sharp and regular tree with nodes evenly spaced along\nits branches.\nThe effect of the weighting in our algorithm can be seen at the\nnode connected directly to the left of the sink in the final configura-\ntion. This node aggregates three flows into one outgoing link. With-\nout weighting, the node would converge to a position much closer\nto its three upstream neighbors than to the sink. However, because\nthe weight of the downstream neighbor is equal to the sum of the\nweights of all upstream neighbors, the node converges instead to a\ncentral location. Another example of the effect of weighting can be\nseen in the node connected directly above the sink. This node has\ntwo upstream neighbors: the one at left aggregating 10 flows and\nthe one at right aggregating 1. We can see that the converged posi-\ntion of the node is only slightly affected by the presence of its right\nupstream neighbor.\nFigures 19 (a) and (b) quantify the performance gain of mobil-\nity control on concast networks. We observe that compared with\nrandom source-destination pairs, concast has slightly lower perfor-\nmance gain, due to concentrated traffic patterns. However, the per-\nformance gain is still substantial. This substantial improvement in\ncommunication cost translates into a lax design requirement for low\nmobility cost. Figure 19 (c) shows the trade-off between mobility\nenergy cost and communication cost. We observe similar behaviors\nas those of multiple source-destination pairs. A notable difference\nhowever, is that performance gains are realized through mobility af-\nter relatively little traffic has been sent. This concast consists of \u0000 \u0014\nflows, yet exhibits crossing times as little as \u0017\u0018\u0014 times those of the\nsingle flow scenario. This makes sense if one considers the fact that\nin concast, many nodes are junction nodes, and their movement si-\nmultaneously helps many flows. Hence, in concast, small amounts\nof mobility tend to result in strikingly large performance gains.\nNext, we evaluate the performance improvement of mobility con-\ntrol when there are multiple concast sinks. This can be a good model\nfor many scenarios, for example GHT [23].
