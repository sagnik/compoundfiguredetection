To better illustrate the scaling behavior, we vary the number of unlabeled\npatterns used for training (from 1; 000 up to a maximum of 1 million). Following [1], the width of\nthe Gaussian kernel is set to \f = 0:25. For the reduced LapSVM implementation, we \u0002x r = 200.\n","Results are shown in Figure 1. Both the LapSVM and SLapCVM always attain 100% accuracy on\nthe test set, even with only two labeled examples (Figure 1(b)). However, SLapCVM is faster than\nLapSVM (Figure 1(c)). Moreover, as mentioned in Section 2.1, the LapSVM solution is non-sparse\n","and all the labeled and unlabeled examples are involved in the solution (Figure 1(d))). On the other\nhand, SLapCVM uses only a small fraction of the examples. As can be seen from Figures 1(c)\nand 1(d), both the time and space required by the SLapCVM are almost constant, even when the\nunlabeled data set gets very large. The reduced LapSVM, though also fast, is slightly inferior to\nboth the SLapCVM and LapSVM. Moreover, note that both the standard and reduced LapSVMs\ncannot be run on the full data set on our PC because of their large memory requirements.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,862,699,896],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[158,734,699,857]}
