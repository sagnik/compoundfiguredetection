And when it has moved away\nfrom the transition area, the conﬁdence of ASR 6 decreases\ndramatically and the peak is now centered on ASR 7.\nFigure 6 shows the distribution of weighting used on the\nlocalization strategies for calculating the overall conﬁdence\nvalues. The solid line is the plot of distance method weights\nand the dashed line represents the weights of the relative ori-\nentation method. For the ﬁrst three ASRs, the weights for\nboth distance and orientation are initialized to be 0.5 because\nwe only start computations after the third ASR. The ASR dis-\ntance weight then increases, because the conﬁdence on ASR\ndistance is higher than the conﬁdence computed from the ori-\nentation method. As time progresses, the weights of the dis-\ntance method decrease due to a decrease in conﬁdence, and\nvice versa for conﬁdence from the orientation method.\nThe results from the conﬁdencemaps show that the method\nproposed provides a consistent approach for using an inexact\n\u201Ccognitive map\u201D to allow a mobile robot to ﬁnd its way back\nhome. It does not provide the exact pose of the robot in the\nenvironment, but rather an approximation, which we believe\nis sufﬁcient for navigation and new exploration.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[436,514,776,544],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[460,388,751,499]}
