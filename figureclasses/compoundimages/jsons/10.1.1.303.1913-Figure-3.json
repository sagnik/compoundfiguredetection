a first experiment, we tried to find strong plans only.\nTo enable proofs of unsolvability, we ran FF without helpful\nactions pruning, and we included in the input only the subset\nof actions affecting the relevant BO (else the state space is\nalways much too vast to be exhausted). Overall, only 10%\nof the instances could be solved; on 15%, FF ran out of time\nor memory; 75% of them were proved unsolvable.\nStrong plans are rare in SAM. We now report detailed re-\nsults for the more generous semantics as per Definition 1,\nallowing failed action outcomes as long as they are provably\nfailed. In our baseline, we include all actions in the input\n(not only those of the relevant BO), because (a) helpful ac-\ntions pruning will detect the irrelevant actions anyway, and\n(b) in the long term SAM will model cross-BO interactions.\nWe identify two parameters relevant to the performance of\nFF: the kind of BO considered, and |G|. Figure 3 shows how\ncoverage and state evaluations (number of calls to the heuris-\ntic function) depend on these parameters. Consider first Fig-\nure 3 (a). The x-axis ranges over BOs, i.e., each data point\n","instances within that BO. We see that, in 275 of the 371\nkinds of BOs, coverage is perfect. For another 65 BOs, cov-\nerage is above 70%. For the remaining 32 BOs, coverage\nis rather bad. The fraction of unsolved instances peaks at\n81.92% and the fraction of failed instances peaks at 14.98%.\nConsidering Figure 3 (b), we see how coverage is affected\nby |G| (shown on the x-axis). |G| = 1 is handled perfectly,\nfollowed by a fairly steady decline as |G| grows. An expla-\nnation for the discontinuity at |G| = 3, 4 could be that for\n|G| = 3 our experiment is exhaustive while for |G| = 4 we\nonly sample. The discontinuity at |G| = 13, 14 is largely\ndue to BO structure. Few BOs have more than 12 variables.\nThose with 13 variables happen to be exceptionally chal-\nlenging, while almost all of the instances for |G| > 13 are\nfrom a BO that is not quite as challenging.\nConsider now Figures 3 (c) and (d) which provide a\ndeeper look into performance on those instances where FF\nterminated regularly (plan found or helpful actions search\nspace exhausted).6 In (c), the most striking observation is\nthat, for 350 of the 371 BOs, the maximum number of state\nevaluations is below 100; for solved instances, this even\nholds for 364 BOs. In fact, in all but a single BO we always\nneed less than 1000 evaluations to find a plan. The single\n","In Figure 3 (d), we see that the overall behavior of state\nevaluations over |G| largely mirrors that of coverage, in-\ncluding the discontinuities at |G| = 3, 4 and |G| = 13, 14\n(the \u201CUNSOLVEDMAX\u201D curve is flat because larger search\nspaces lead to failure). The most notable exception is the\nfairly consistent decline of \u201CSOLVED MAX\u201D for |G| > 3.\nIt is unclear to us what the reason for that is.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,549,775,580],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[102,85,743,550]}
