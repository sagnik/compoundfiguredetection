{"Caption":"Figure 3: Modelselection and evaluation. Left subplots: Selection of hyperparameter ξ of the iCSP method. For each subject, a cross-validation was performed for different values of ξ on the training data (session imag_move), see thin black line, and the ξ resulting in minimum error was chosen (red circle). For the same values of ξ the iCSP filters + LDA classifier trained on imag_move were applied to calculate the test error on data from imag_lett (thick colorful line). Right plot: Test error in all four recordings for classical CSP and the proposed iCSP (with model parameter ξ chosen by cross-validation on the training set as described in Section 4).
