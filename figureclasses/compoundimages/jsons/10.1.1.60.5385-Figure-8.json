To adapt for this\nsituation, δ should increase, to be able to detect the\ncausality relations.\nThe performance of both algorithms is sketched in\nFigure 8. From Figure 8(a), it is clear that the space\nusage of Streaming-Rules is consistently 2.5 to 2.8\ntimes smaller than that of Omni-Data, which is a great\nadvantage. The run times of both algorithms were very\nsimilar, since both utilize the same data structure, the\nsame Unique-Count technique, and the data set was\nrelatively small. The recall of Streaming-Rules was\nconstant at 1, since its errors are false positives only.\nThe precision and guarantee both varied between 0.974\nand 0.989. Thus there was almost no loss of accuracy.\nThe results are interesting. There was a set of sus-\npicious sites A that are always being requested before\nanother set of sites B with conﬁdence at least 0.5. This\nheld even when δ = 10, which is a very small value for\nδ. Hence, we can guess that there is a direct relation-\nship between these two sets. Even more interesting is\nthe fact that the A sites did not have high frequency,\nas estimated by the antecedent Stream-Summary.\nIt is not possible to check out the results, even if\nwe know the URLs. Internet Browsers record the re-\nferring site, and not the referred to site, in the history.\nFor instance, if page a.com has an invisible frame of\nheight 0, where another page b.net gets loaded when\na loads, the Browser records only a.com in the his-\ntory. Thus, visiting a.com, and then looking for b.net\nin the history is not eﬀective. Only an entity that\nmonitors the HTTP requests made, like ISPs, can test\na relationship that Streaming-Rules reported for being\nfraudulent.\n"],"Page":11,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[478,694,725,709],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[424,557,785,686]}
