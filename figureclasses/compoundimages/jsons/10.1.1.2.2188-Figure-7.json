of squared error and execution time respectively.\nWhen the skew is small, the values of the measures\nare very similar and most of detail wavelet coefficients\nbecome zero. Thus, the error becomes very small. As\nthe skew increases more, the measure values become\ndifferent and the detail wavelet coefficients start to\nhave non-zero values. It results in larger errors.\nHowever, as the skew parameter increases even larger\n(after 1.5) values, the large coefficients are restricted\nto a smaller area for each distribution. This produces\nthe reduction of the weighted sum of squared error of\nthe results, as the number of significantly influencing\ncoefficients becomes smaller. On the other hand, the\nprobability that coefficients from multiple measures\nbecome important simultaneously becomes smaller.\nThis explains the shape of the average weighted\nsum of squared error graph in Figure 7-(d). Even\nthough the graphs of the errors of both algorithms\nare close, the error of ApproxWave is slightly better\nthat that of GreedyL2. However, regardless of skew\nchanges, the execution times do not show any big\nchange. It is expected since the time complexities of\nboth algorithms are not dependent on skew in data\ndistribution. ApproxWave is again much faster than\nthat of GreedyL2.\n","Storage Space: In Figure 7-(a) and Figure 7-(b),\nwe present the execution time and average weighted\nsum squared error for approximation algorithms as\nthe storage space is varied from 1K to 1M bytes.\nWe set the number of measures M to 30 and the\nskew parameter of the data distributions within each\nregion was set to 1.0. The errors of both GreedyL2\nand ApproxWave are very close, but the error of\nApproxWave is slightly better than that of GreedyL2.\nFurthermore, the speed of ApproxWave is much faster\nthan that of GreedyL2.\n","Skew within Region: We modified the zipfian\nparameter controlling the skew of the measure\u2019s data\ndistributions within each region from 0.5 to 4 and we\nset B to 100K bytes.
