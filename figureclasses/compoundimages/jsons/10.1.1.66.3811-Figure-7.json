For\nexponential and Pareto distributions, this conditional probability is e−λT and 2k respectively. Figures 5(b)\nand 6(b) plot this conditional probability computed from PL trace for TTF and TTR respectively, along\nwith the probabilities computed for exponential and Pareto fits. Clearly the conditional probability from the\ntrace follows the exponential distribution more closely. As shown in Figure 7, we observe similar behavior\nfor TTF in WS trace. The behavior for TTR in WS trace shown in Figure 8(a) has a better Pareto fit than an\nexponential fit. However, for this particular fitting, Figure 8(b) and (c) show that even the Pareto distribution\nonly gives us a prediction accuracy (the conditional probability) of 0.51. This value of 0.51 is much lower\nthan the conditional probability for Pareto in previous cases. For this reason, we argue that a good fitting\nto a Pareto distribution here does necessarily imply predictability. A direct examination of the conditional\nprobability from the data (Figure 8 (b) and (c)) shows that 62% of data points for the conditional probability\nfrom the data are below 0.5. This roughly means that with 62% probability, the prediction accuracy will\nbe below 50%. We thus argue that the TTR in WS trace has poor predictability as well. In DNS trace,\nthe time period between two consecutive probes to the same DNS server follows an exponential distribution\nwith a mean of 1 hour. This relatively large period between probes (as compared to around 15 minutes in\nPL trace and WS trace) can cause inaccuracies in individual TTR and TTF values, and, thus, we do not\nperform the above analysis for DNS trace. Overall, our analysis shows that the TTF and TTR of a node are\nhard to predict based on how long the node has been up or down.\nAlthough we cannot predict how long a machine will remain up given how long it has been up, is it\npossible to predict TTF (or TTR) from MTTF (or MTTR)? Specifically, if the variation in TTF (or TTR)\n","Majority Voting Systems (Principle applied: P4). Correlation in failures can significantly affect the\nbehavior of traditional fault-tolerant designs such as majority voting [14]. Figure 17 shows the unavailability\nof a simulated majority voting system with nodes having the MTTF(≈ 9.9 days) and MTTR(≈ 1.8 days)\nthat we found for PlanetLab machines. We model the correlated failures using the geometric distribution\nmentioned in Section 2.4 with ρ = 0.56. As the graph shows, majority voting is significantly worse under\ncorrelated failures. In real systems where we observe higher correlation than modeled by the geometric\ndistribution, we expect further decay in availability. This implies that correlation in today\u2019s real systems\nhas reached such a level that it has to be considered explicitly in system design. For example, signed\nquorum systems [15] may potentially be used in place of majority voting to provide better protection against\ncorrelated failures.\n","that gaps due to the reason 1 as node failures. For gaps due to the reason 2, we assume that a node status\ndoes not change during those gaps.\nWe have also analyzed Planet-Lab all-pair-ping measurements for seven months starting from April\n2004 to strengthen the conclusions we have drawn in the main study. In table 1, we present the distribution\nof unique gaps across the nodes in the system. We list all gaps observed for all nodes and compute the\ndistribution of those gaps. We found 163 unique different gaps in the PL trace and have observed that\nseven of those gaps occur in all nodes\u2019 data (about 350 nodes). Remaining 157 gaps correspond to those\ngaps that have occured at individual nodes due to the first reason.\nWe have found that the four principles we deduce still hold in the seven month dataset. Below, we\npresent the results of our analysis with the seven-month data from Planet-Lab answering the four questions\nthat we pose in the Section 1. Figure 23 shows the relationship of Availability with MTTF and MTTR for all\nnodes in the trace. Here also, we observe that among 27%(26%) of all possible pairs of machines, the one\nwith higher availability does not have higher MTTF(lower MTTR, respectively) in the trace. In Figure 24,\nwe plot the MTTR and MTTF for individual machines and again we observe a small correlation between\nthose two metrics (r =−0.07).\nIn Figures 25 and 26, we present the analysis of TTF and TTR of all machines for the seven-month trace\nin a similar way as in [8]. We again observe that exponential fits the observed data than Pareto distribution\nand hence get to same conclusion. We plot the coefficient of variance in TTF and TTR in Figure 27.
