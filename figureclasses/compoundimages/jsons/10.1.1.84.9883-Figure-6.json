The primary shell of \nthe LaunchTile design is an interactive zoomspace consisting \nof 36 application tiles, divided into 9 zones of 4 tiles each \n(Figure 4c). The 36 tile configuration is an exploration of the \nmaximum number of applications that can reasonably fit \nwithin the display space. Since the design is fundamentally \nscalable, however, it can display any number of tiles up to \n36, and fewer may even be preferable. As a central design \nelement, LaunchTile uses a large blue onscreen button, called \nBlue (Figure 4a), to unify the shell and applications with a \nconsistent visual metaphor. Blue provides a consistent point \nof reference for zooming and panning navigation, with \nonscreen tiles, menus, and functions maintaining a consistent \nrelative position to Blue. The LaunchTile zoomspace consists \nof 3 zoom levels: World (36 tiles, Figure 4c), Zone (4 tiles, \nFigures 4a and b) and Application (1 tile, Figure 4d). \n","The second test phase evaluated accuracy and efficiency for \ngoal-directed navigation tasks. The average task success rate \nwas 95%. While both navigation and navigation+activation \ntasks were performed with 98% accuracy, activation was \nclose behind at 96%. Cancellation tasks, however, were only \ncompleted correctly 83% of the time. On average, \nparticipants performed 2.4 additional steps than the optimal \nnumber to complete a task. Breaking participants into three \nperformance groups for each task, it is clear that one third of \nparticipants performed nearly optimally on all but a few tasks \n(Figure 6). The Middle third of participants performed \ncomparably to the Top  third, but the gaps were wider on the \ntasks the Top third had trouble with. That is, the tasks for \nwhich the Middle third deviated farthest from Optimal, were \nthose for which the Top-tier also deviated. Thus, the most \nsignificant difficulties in performing the navigation phase \ntasks were experienced by only a third of the participants.  \n"],"Page":7,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,316,773,346],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,117,783,309]}
