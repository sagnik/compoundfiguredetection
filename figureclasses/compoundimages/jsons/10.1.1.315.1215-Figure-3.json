Figure 2 we plot the results of our method (named\nRankMatch), for M = R, compared to those achieved by\na number of state-of-the-art methods which have published\nNDCG scores in at least two of the datasets: RankBoost [7],\nRankSVM [4], FRank [6], ListNet [5], AdaRank [33], QBRank\n[35], IsoRank [34], SortNet [25], StructRank [10] and C-CRF\n[24]. RankMatch performs among the best methods in both\nTD2004 and OHSUMED, while in TD2003 it performs poorly\n(for low k) or fairly well (for high k).\nIn Figure 3 we compare variants of our method for differ-\nent values of M . Overall, we observe that our method does\nnot seem to benefit from the use of larger M . This is intu-\nitively plausible, since if M > R, documents with the same\nrelevance appear in different orders during training, which may\ncreate unnecessary bias. It would be highly interesting to ap-\nply our method to datasets with more (say, 5) relevance degrees\n\u2013 we suspect the method could better leverage the training set\nin such cases since we could still have exact gradient compu-\ntation while at the same time explicitly enforcing the relative\npreferences during training.\nWe first notice that there are four methods which only report\nresults in two of the three datasets: the two SortNet versions\nare only reported in TD2003 and TD2004, while StructRank\nand C-CRF are only reported in TD2004 and OHSUMED.\nRankMatch compares similarly with SortNet and StructRank\nin TD2004, similarly to C-CRF and StructRank in OHSUMED\nand similarly to the two versions of SortNet in TD2003. This\nexhausts all the comparisons against the methods which have\nresults reported in only two datasets. A fairer comparison could\nbe made if these methods had their performance published for\nthe respective missing dataset.\nWhen compared to the methods which report results in all\ndatasets, RankMatch entirely dominates their performance in\nTD2004 and is second only to IsoRank in OHSUMED (and\nperforming similarly to QBRank).\nThese results should be interpreted cautiously; [21] present\nan interesting discussion about issues with these datasets. Also,\nbenchmarking of ranking algorithms is still in its infancy and\nwe don\u2019t yet have publicly available code for all of the compet-\nitive methods. We expect this situation to change in the near\nfuture so that we are able to compare them on a fair and trans-\nparent basis, under public scrutiny.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[89,382,756,397],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[67,96,770,366]}
