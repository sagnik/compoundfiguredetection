To further illus-\ntrate this, Figure 2(b) shows the cumulative density func-\ntion for the session times of the trace. As the figure shows,\nmore than 99% of all sessions last less than 2 hours.\nUnlike the player patience data, session times can not\nbe fitted with a simple negative exponential distribution.\nHowever, the data can be closely matched to a Weibull dis-\ntribution, a more general distribution that is often used to\nmodel lifetime distributions in reliability engineering [22].\nSince quitting the game can be viewed as an attention \u201Cfail-\nure\u201D on the part of the player, the Weibull distribution is\nwell-suited for this application. The generalized Weibull\ndistribution has three parameters β, η, and γ and is shown\nbelow.\n","the weekends during some parts of the year.

We were un-\nable to apply this technique however, due to the reliance of\nwavelet MRA on resolutions that are factors of two apart.\nThe difference between our two cycles is seven.\nIn order to quantify the week-to-week variation of game\nworkloads, Figure 9 shows distribution of week-to-week\nload changes of the top 5 games during 2004: Half-Life,\nBattlefield 1942, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Amer-\nica\u2019s Army, and Neverwinter Nights.
