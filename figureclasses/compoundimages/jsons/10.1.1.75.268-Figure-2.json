The\nphylogenetic profiles appear as the most informative\nones, while localization data alone does not bring much\ninformation at all about enzyme relations. This is also\nconfirmed by attribute ranking, where we found that\nthe first five attributes correspond to phylogenetic fea-\ntures, while the last 20 ones are almost all localization\nvariables.
