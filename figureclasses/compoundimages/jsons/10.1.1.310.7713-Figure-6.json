In this regime of noise and spiking\nbudget, the optimal population size was around 100 neurons. Next, we repeated the analysis but\nused neurons with fixed precision, i.e., the spike budget was scaled with the population to give 1\nnoisy neuron or 150 equally noisy neurons (Fig. 6b). As the population grows, more information is\ntransmitted, but the rate of increase slows. This suggests that incorporating an additional penalty,\nsuch as a fixed metabolic cost per neuron, would allow us to predict the optimal number of canonical\nnoisy neurons.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,242,700,272],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[151,96,698,239]}
