If the relationship \nbetween EIPVs and CPI is entirely random, any \u201Coptimal \nsplit\u201D decision made on 90% of the data may not \ngeneralize when using the remaining 10% of the data.

Figure 13 \nshows a conceptual two dimensional space. The X-\ndimension is the CPI variance and the Y-dimension is the \nrelative error in predicting CPI with EIPVs, i.e. CPI \npredictability. The X-axis indicates the degree of CPI \nvariance, with low variance to the left and high variance to \nthe right. The Y-axis indicates the degree of predictable \nphase behavior based on the value of the relative error. In \nthis paper we chose a CPI variance threshold of 0.01 for \ndifferentiating two regions along the X-dimension. We use \na relative error of 0.15 as the threshold for differentiating \nthe two regions along the Y-dimension. Using these two \nthresholds, we can identify four quadrants of workload \nbehaviors as shown in Figure 13.  \nBenchmarks in Q-I have insignificant CPI variance \nand exhibit limited phase behavior, where CPI can not be \nexplained using EIPVs. A Q-II benchmark has low CPI \nvariance but still exhibits strong phase behavior, so even \nthe low CPI variance can be explained using EIPVs. \nSimilarly, benchmarks in Q-III and Q-IV both have high \nCPI variance, but their phase behavior ranges from weak \nto strong. \n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[445,712,762,726],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,247,768,713]}
