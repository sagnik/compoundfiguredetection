{"Caption":"Figure 1. Results of the inversion for an ensemble of acceptable shear velocity models at a location in western Kazakhstan (44◦ N, 64◦ E) using an ad-hoc seismic parametrization. (a) Four dispersion curves obtained from surface wave velocity maps (thick black lines) and the predictions from the ensemble of acceptable models (gray lines). (b) The ensemble of acceptable radially anisotropic models, where v sv and v sh are shown with dark and light gray shades, respectively. The corridor of acceptable values is indicated with the solid black lines and the 1-D model ak135 (Kennett et al. 1995) is plotted as the dashed line for reference.
