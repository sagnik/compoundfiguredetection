this section, we investigate the effects of delay costs \nwhose range is varied under a fixed misclassification cost. \nFor each misclassification cost (FP\/FN=1k\/6k, 2k\/6k, \n4k\/6k, and FP\/FN=6k\/6k, we vary the three ranges of the \ndelay costs ([0..50], [0..100], and [0..200]). We repeat this \nprocess 25 times, and the average number of batches for \nthe 10 datasets is plotted in Figure 4.  \n","Note that from Figure 4 we can see that the number of \nbatches is often less than 1 especially when the ratios of \nmissing attributes are small (such as 0.2). This is because \nwith a small percentage of missing values, often the SBT \nalgorithm does not need to acquire any missing values \nwhen classifying test examples by the decision tree.  \n","From Figure 4, we can draw some interesting \nconclusions: First of all, the smaller the delay cost range, \nthe more the number of batches (for the same ratio of \nunknown attributes). This meets our expectation: when \nthe delay cost is small, it is preferable to have small batch \nsizes (thus more batches in sequence), as it is better to \nwait to obtain attribute values so that they can help to \nmake decision for the next attribute(s) more accurately \nand save money from unnecessary attribute acquisition. \nThe extreme case is zero (0) attribute delay cost. Under \nthis case, it is preferable to do one test at a time. Our \nexperiment results show that the average number of \nbatches in this case is the highest. When the range of the \ndelay cost is high, we can expect that SBT will reduce the \nnumber of batches to save the total cost, as shown in \nFigure 5. \n"],"Page":6,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,560,400,591],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[81,355,392,556]}
