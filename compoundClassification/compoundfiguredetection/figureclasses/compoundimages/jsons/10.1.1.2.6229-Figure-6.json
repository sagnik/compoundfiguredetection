In order\nto see the difference between the PDM and our skeleton\nstrength map (SSM), we consider a simple 1D function, as\ncolored by blue in Fig.6(a). This is a box functionwith same\ncontrast on both sides. The pseudo-distance map of this\nfunction is given by light blue color in Fig.6(a). The skele-\nton strength maps, generated by isotropic vector diffusion\n(Eq.(1)) and anisotropic vector diffusion (Eq.(2)), are given\nby green and red curves, respectively, in Fig.6(a). We can\nsee from this example that our skeleton strength maps give\n\u201Csharper\u201D ridges. We can also observe that the anisotropic\ndiffusion performs better than the isotropic diffusion.\n","Finally let us address the bias problem, as we mentioned\nearlier. For this purpose, we consider a (1D) box func-\ntion with different contrasts on both sides, as colored by\nblue in Fig.6(b). The green curve shows the results of our\nskeleton strengthmap (anisotropic), fromwhichwe can cor-\nrectly locate the skeleton at the center of the box, as indi-\ncated by green arrow in the figure. In contrast, we consider\ntwo classical linear methods. One is the direct convolu-\ntion of a Gaussian kernel with the original data (e.g., see\n[12, 13, 17]). The result of the convolution is shown by red\ncurve in Fig.6(b). The other linear system, as used in [10], is\nmore general, where the edge strength map is first generated\nand diffused. The skeletons are then extracted from certain\ncritical points of the diffused edge strength map (e.g., see\n","[10]). The result of the diffused edge strength map is shown\nby light blue color in Fig.6(b). From this figure, we can\nconclude that both linear methods yield biased skeletons,\nas indicated by red and light blue arrows. The skeletons\n\u201Cshift\u201D to the side with lower contrast. The bias problem\nwas discussed in details in [17], where a lot of efforts have\nto be made to remove the bias from the extracted skeletons.\nFrom the above description, we can see that this problem\ncan be easily solved using our anisotropic vector diffusion.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[370,972,479,987],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[150,780,701,958]}
