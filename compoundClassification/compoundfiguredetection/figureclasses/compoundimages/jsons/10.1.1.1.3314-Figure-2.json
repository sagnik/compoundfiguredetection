{"Caption":"Figure 2: Incoming message rates. The top plot shows the cumulative histogram of incoming message rate, cal- culated on a per sender basis and normalized. The graph shows that the message rates for good (*) and junk (+) mail are very similar, and most of the mail is sent at a very low rate (92\u201394% of servers send mes- sages at 1 message\/minute). The lower plot shows the cumulative histogram of messages, calculated by assum- ing that each server sends all its messages at its maxi- mum rate. This is therefore a worst case estimate of the proportion of mail sent at different rates. The bulk of both junk and good messages are sent at rates of less than 10 messages\/minute.
