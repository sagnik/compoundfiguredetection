Table 2 describes the test parameters. Figure\n3(b) shows the time taken by the algorithm, while Figure\n3(a) shows the accuracy of the algorithm. It can be clearly\nseen that the accuracy is close to 100% when we look at\ntwice the number of real roles, and close to 85% when we\nlook at exactly the number of real roles in the results. This\nis quite good. The algorithm also runs quite fast, taking\naround 5 minutes on the largest datasets.\nIn the second set of experiments, we kept the number of\nroles and permissions constant while varying the number\nof users. Table 3 describes the test parameters. Figure\n4(a) shows the time taken by the algorithm, while Figure\n4(b) shows the accuracy of the algorithm. Here, we can see\nthat accuracy actually increases with the number of users.\nThe algorithm performs quite well as long as the number of\nroles is not more than 1\/10th the number of users. This is\nquite realistic, and therefore the algorithm should perform\nwell in real situations. Again, the speed of the algorithm is\nquite good, with the largest datasets (of 5000 users) taking\napproximately 23 minutes.\nIn the third set of experiments we keep the permissions\nconstant, and vary the number of users as well as the num-\nber of roles. Table 4 describes the test parameters. Figure\n5(a) shows the time taken by the algorithm, while Figure\n5(b) shows the accuracy of the algorithm. This actually\ngives a surprising result \u2013 the accuracy of the algorithm\nsignificantly drops off at the largest data point (with 5000\nusers\/500 roles). Similarly, the running time drastically in-\ncreases as well. However, this is not due to the number\nof users (as the earlier experiment showed), but rather due\nto the number of roles vis-a-vis the number of permissions.\nWhen the ratio of permissions to roles is small (in this case,\n1500\/500 = 3), the algorithm performs quite poorly.
