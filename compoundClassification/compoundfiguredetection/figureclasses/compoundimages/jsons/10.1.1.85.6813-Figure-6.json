{"Caption":"Figure 6: Results: The LEFT plot shows precision vs. recall curves for models of r. The results for δx and δy are shown separately (as there are often more horizontal than vertical features on cars, δy is better). Re-estimating parameters of the global alignment, W (affine fit), significantly improves the curves. Finally, performance is improved by combining position with appearance (\u201CComplete\u201D curve) compared to using appearance alone. The CENTER pair of images show a correct match, with the patch centers indicated by circles. The color of the circles in the top image indicates MI j , in bottom image LLRj . Our patch selection algorithm chooses the top patches based on MI where subsequent patches are penalized for overlapping with earlier ones (neighborhood suppression). The top 10 \u201Cleft\u201D patches chosen are marked with arrows connecting them to the corresponding \u201Cright\u201D patches. Notice that these are concentrated in informative regions. The RIGHT plot quantifies this observation: the curves show 3 different methods of choosing the order of patches - random order, MI and MI with neighborhood suppression. Notice that this top curve with 3 patches does as well as the direct comparison method. All 3 methods converge above 50 patches.
