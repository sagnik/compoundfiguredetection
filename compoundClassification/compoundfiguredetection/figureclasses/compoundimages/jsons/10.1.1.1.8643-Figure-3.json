If we blindly apply the tracking algo-\nrithm, it will either track the background if a large region is used, or lose the ball if the\ntracking region is small and the movement is large. We utilize the background information\nand assume a mask about the tracked object is available. We initialize the model with a\nregion in frame 3 of size 48 × 48. The bandwidths are (h, σ) = (18, 12). We only keep\nthe foreground pixels in the model and run the tracking algorithm. The algorithm reliably\nand accurately tracks the ball with average number of iteration 2.7679 and average pro-\ncessing time per frame 0.0169s. In contrast, to successfully track this sequence, in [3] a\nbackground-weighted histogram was employed. The tracking results shown in Figure 2 are\nmore accurate than those in [3]. The number of iterations and sums of squared differences\nbetween the model image and the tracked images are shown in Figure 3. The results of our\nmethod are more accurate and number of iterations is smaller than the method using the\nBhattacharyya distance.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,828,675,855],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[206,656,644,820]}
