{"Caption":"Figure 11: Server network throughput and disk throughput for trans- fers along T3 links of a file with size between 256MB and 1GB. The system load is set equal to 40%. With out-of-order transfers the the net- work throughput is always higher and the disk throughput is constant regardless of the size of the file.
