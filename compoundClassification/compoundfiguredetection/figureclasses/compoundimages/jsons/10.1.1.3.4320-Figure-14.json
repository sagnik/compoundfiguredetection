Specifically, we discard\npredictions with confidence below a threshold and analyze\nthe accuracy of the remaining predictions. The hypothe-\nsis is that higher-confidence predictions are more accurate\nthan lower-confidence predictions. Inevitably, as the confi-\ndence threshold increases there will be accurate predictions\ndiscarded due to insufficient confidence. Loosely speak-\ning, the PRP system may have a \u201Clucky guess\u201D and, without\nknowing the target waypoint at the time of prediction, it is\nimpossible to discriminate between lucky guesses and well-\ninformed estimates. Using the training set, we can deter-\nmine a confidence threshold that strikes a balance between\nquality and quantity. We fix the value of Æ = 0:7 and have\nthe learning algorithm construct a CDHMM based on Fig-\nure 10 for each program in the four-program training set\nand analyze the performance of the PRP system as a func-\ntion of confidence threshold. In Figure 13, we plot the per-\ncentage of useful predictions as a function of the confidence\nthreshold on the four-program training set. The percentage\nof useful predictions generally increases as the confidence\nthreshold increases until about \u001E\nn\n\u0015 0:8, when the percent-\nage plateaus. In Figure 14, we plot the average median error\nas a function of the confidence threshold. For all confidence\nthresholds the angle error is extremely small, between 0:06\nand 0:2 milliradians. The median angle movement during\nprediction was about 65 milliradians, meaning that the an-\ngle prediction error is between 0:09% and 0:3% of the angle\nchange. However, the Cartesian prediction error improves\nas the confidence threshold increases, until it bottoms out\n"],"Page":14,"Number":14,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[427,392,756,423],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[437,124,748,372]}
