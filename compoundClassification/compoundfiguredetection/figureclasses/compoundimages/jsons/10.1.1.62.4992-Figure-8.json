{"Caption":"Figure 8. Speaker veriﬁcation results using only audio signal and audio-visual signal. Acoustic evaluation results are in (a) and veri- ﬁcations (test) results are in (b). The graphs in (c) and (d) show the corresponding evaluation and test results for the combined audio- visual veriﬁcation system. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["used a GMM based speech recognition system based only\non acoustic features. The threshold function, obtained from\nthe evaluation set (Fig. 8a), is used in the test set to map\nthe score into the conﬁdence interval [0, 1]. From the veri-\nﬁcation results on the test set (Fig. 8b), we obtain the equal\nerror rate of 6%. The veriﬁcation rate of 295 speakers was\nthus 94%. In the second test, the system used merged visual\nand acoustic features on the same basis as the earlier sys-\ntem. The veriﬁcation rate of the whole database was 98%\n(Fig. 8d), where the threshold from the evaluation set was\nutilized (Fig. 8c).\nTo quantify the biometric veriﬁcation power of the visual\nfeatures, we carried out the same experiments with these\nfeatures alone. The FA and FR graphs of the veriﬁcation\nresults are given in Fig. 9. The veriﬁcation performance us-\ning the threshold of the evaluation set was 78%. In Table. 1\nwe display the veriﬁcation performance (where FA is equal\nto FR in the evaluation set) of the acoustic, visual, and the\ncombined audio-visual systems using the same test data and\ntest protocol. Speaker veriﬁcation based on audio and visual\nimages from lip-movement give 98% correct classiﬁcation\nwhich is 3-4% better than audio based speaker veriﬁcation.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[100,750,410,820],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[154,93,359,751]}
