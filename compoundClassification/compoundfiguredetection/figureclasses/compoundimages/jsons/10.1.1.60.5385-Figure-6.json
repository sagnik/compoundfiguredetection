When the data is\nmoderately skewed, which is the realistic case [15, 18],\nthere is a higher probability that more combinations\nof elements will occur in the windows, and Omni-Data\nkept complete information about all the pairs that oc-\ncurred. Since not all such pairs are signiﬁcant, with\nmuch less space, Streaming-Rules reported all correct\nrules. For α > 1, the performance gap decreased, since\nsmaller numbers of unique elements occurred in the\nwindows, andOmni-Data did not suﬀer any more from\nkeeping too many counters, unnecessarily.\nAs shown in Figure 6(b), the running time of\nStreaming-Rules is much better than Omni-Data, es-\npecially for moderately skewed data, and bigger δ\u2019s.\nThe performance gap decreased with higher skew.\nFrom this set of experiments, we conclude that in\naddition to handling highly skewed data, Streaming-\nRules can handle weakly skewed data, which is the\nmore realistic case.
