{"Caption":"Figure 4: Correction Results by Lexicion Size","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The size of the trusted lexicon is an important factor influ-\nencing the speller correction result. In order to investigate\nthe effect of lexicon size, we conducted a set of experiments\non both datasets using different lexicon sizes (ranging from\n100,000 to 900,000). Results in Figure 4 show that the ef-\nfect of lexicon size is significant on precision: the precision\nincreases as the lexicon size increases. However the recall is\nnot sensitive to the lexicon size.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[457,259,754,273],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[438,114,790,243]}
