These data are represented as an undirected graph in the first panel of Figure\n2. Like many social networks, these data exhibit a good deal of transitivity. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the best performing models considered (in terms of area under the ROC curve,\ngiven in Table 1) are the distance models, with the eigenmodels close behind. In contrast, the\nlatent class models perform poorly, and the results suggest that increasing K for this model would\nnot improve its performance.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[161,399,688,416],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[165,99,685,376]}
