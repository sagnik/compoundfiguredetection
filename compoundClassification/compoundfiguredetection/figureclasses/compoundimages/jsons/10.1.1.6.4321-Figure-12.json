The clients receive data\nover 10Mbit\/s links, and the system is at 40% load. In\nFigure 12(a), we illustrate the network throughput of the\nserver with sequential and out-of-order transfers respec-\ntively. In the out-of-order case, the measured throughput\nremains roughly 50 MByte\/s with up to 8 files, and drops\nslightly to 48MB\/s with 16 files. From Figure 12(b), the\naverage disk throughput increases linearly with the num-\nber of files up to eight, and reaches 10MB\/s at 16 files.\nThis behavior is expected because the number of disk ac-\ncess streams increases with more active files, and the disk\nthroughput begins to limit the system as it approaches\n10MByte\/s. With sequential transfers, the disk through-\nput always limits the system and performance only wors-\nens as the number of files increases.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[433,332,750,385],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[432,129,740,320]}
