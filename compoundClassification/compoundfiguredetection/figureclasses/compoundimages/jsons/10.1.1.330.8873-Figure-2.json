{"Caption":"Figure 2. Results of estimating KL divergences for various choices of probability distributions. In all plots, the X-axis is the number of data points plotted on a log scale, and the Y-axis is the estimated value. The error bar is obtained by replicating the simulation 250 times. Nt (a, Ik ) denotes a truncated normal distribution of k dimensions with mean (a, . . . , a) and identity covariance matrix.

that this may be a suboptimal rate. We set the kernel width to be relatively small (σ = .1)\nfor one-dimensional data, and choose larger σ for higher dimensions. We use M1 and M2 to denote\nthe estimators (43) and (44), respectively. We compare these methods to algorithm A in Wang et\nal [29], which was shown empirically to be one of the best methods in the literature. This method,\nto be denoted by WKV, is based on data-dependent partitioning of the covariate space. Naturally,\nthe performance of WKV is critically dependent on the amount s of data allocated to each partition;\nhere we report results with s ∼ nγ , where γ = 1\/3, 1\/2, 2\/3.\nThe four plots in Figure 4.2 present results with univariate distributions. We see that the\nestimator M2 generally exhibits the best convergence rate among the estimators considered. The\nWKV estimator performs somewhat less well, and shows sensitivity to the choice of partition size s,\nwith the ranking of the different WKV estimators changing over the experiments. The performance\nof estimator M1 is comparable to that of the WKV estimator, although clearly better in the first\nplot. In Figure 4.2 we present the results with two- and three-dimensional data. Again, estimator\nM2 has the best convergence rates in all examples. The M1 estimator does not converge in the\nlast example, suggesting that the underlying function class exhibits very strong bias. In these\nexamples, the WKV estimator again shows sensitivity to the choice of partition size; moreover, its\nperformance is noticeably degraded in the case of three-dimensional data (the lower two plots).\nIt is worth noting that as one increases the number of dimensions, histogram-based methods\nsuch as WKV become increasingly difficult to implement, whereas increased dimension has only a\nmild effect on the complexity of implementation of our method.\n"],"Page":18,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[121,765,728,829],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[146,229,704,737]}
