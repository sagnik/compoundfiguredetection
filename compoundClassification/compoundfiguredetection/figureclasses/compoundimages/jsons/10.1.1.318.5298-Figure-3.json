in Figures 3(b) and 3(c), the gap increases further for more\ndemanding settings. However, the random approach leads to a con-\nsiderable loss in utility for the requester. Assuming a uniform dis-\ntribution of the prices and scoring values in [0,1] and a reasonable\nnumber of offers (> 50) an optimal algorithm leads to a utility of al-\nmost 1 while the random algorithm results only in a average utility\nof 0.\n","Can we improve the performance of optimal selection by constrain-\ning the bidding language? How does the performance of the opti-\nmal selection variants differ? Variants [V2] and [V3] of the mmp-\npredicate assume an additive structure of the pricing and scoring\nfunction. As discussed above, this allows a more efficient imple-\nmentation. [V2] reduces the runtime compared to [V1] from 17\nto 11 seconds in the first setting and from 477 to 41 in the sec-\nond setting (both with 2000 offers). [V3] further reduces the run-\ntime to 5 and 13 seconds, respectively. If we now compare this\nimproved performance to the random algorithm, the cost of opti-\nmality is rather moderate. In particular, considering setting 3 with\n1000 offers and 1600 configurations per offer, there is only a slow-\ndown by 35% when moving from random selection to [V3] (Figure\n3(c)). Comparing this number to smaller settings we can observe\nmuch greater slowdowns which, at first glance, seems contradic-\ntory. However, this observation can be explained by the fact that\nfor large-scale scenarios (more that 1000 configurations per offer)\nquery answering becomes the predominant factor compared to the\noptimization in [V3]. Since query answering is required for both\nalgorithms, variant [V3] and random selection converge.\n","How does the performance change when moving towards preference-\nand context-aware selection strategies? How expensive is optimal-\nity? To investigate the additional time required for evaluating the\noffers and configurations according to preferences, we compare the\nmost general optimal variant [V1] with a baseline algorithm that\nrandomly selects an offer and corresponding configuration from the\nknowledge base. Figure 3 shows the interrelation between the num-\nber of offers in the knowledge base, the number of configurations\nin an offer and the resulting query time. In the first setting (Figure\n3(a)) each bid contains exactly 100 configurations. Service selec-\ntion can be done in less than a second for 2000 offers using the\nrandom algorithm, while [V1] requires about 17 seconds.
