the following experiments, after the setup phase, each\nmote periodically attempts to route to a random des-\ntination mote. We present BVR routing performance\nin terms of successful packet delivery under increasing\nrouting load. In these tests we do not experiment with\nbeacon selection, and just preconfigure 5 well spread\nnodes to act as beacons. In the following section we\nevaluate our implementation of beacon selection using\nthe low-level mote simulator TOSSIM [18].\nFigure 9 present results for the Office-Net and Univ-\nNet testbeds. The graphs show: (1) the overall success\nrate measured as the fraction of routes that arrived at the\ntarget destination, (2) the fraction of routes that required\nscoped flooding, (3) the fraction of routes that failed due\nto contention drops where contention drops are pack-\nets that were dropped due to a lack of sending buffers\nalong the internal send path in the mote network stack\nand (4) failures which are routes that failed despite the\nmultiple retries; i.e., the message was repeatedly sent out\nover the channel but no acknowledgments were received.\nThe graph also plots the aggregate network route request\nrate over time with the scale on the right hand Y axis.\nOur tests start (after the setup phase) with a rate of one\nroute request per second for a period of approximately\none hour; after this we increase the route request rate ev-\nery 400 seconds up to a maximum rate of approximately\n8 routes\/second.\nOn Office-Net, BVR achieved an average success rate\n(greedy or flood) of 99.9% until a load of about 8.8 re-\nquests\/second, at which point we start seeing a small\nnumber of contention drops. 1.2% of all route requests\nin this period resulted in scoped flooding (with an aver-\nage scope of 2 hops), and less than 0.1% were contention\ndrops. Similarly for Univ-Net, the average success rate\nwas 98.5%. 5.5% of all routes required scoped flooding\n(with again an average scope of 2 hops), there were no\ncontention drops, and 1.15% of routes failed due to per-\nsistent loss.
