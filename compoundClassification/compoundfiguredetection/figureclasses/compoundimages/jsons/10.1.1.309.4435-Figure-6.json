{"Caption":"Figure 6: Evaluation of the options of the MIP optimizer over example query Q1 . MIP optimization does not add significant overhead to the TiQL to MIP translation time, but each optimization individually results in significant gains in the MIP solver execution times, and consequently the total T IRESIAS runtime. The MIP solver crashes on the 5k instance when any optimization is turned off, hence the absence of those points.

MIP optimizer reduces the size of the produced problem\nfiles with optimizations that are to some extend already incorpo-\nrated in modern solvers (e.g. elimination of variables and con-\nstraints). Our first set of experiments explores whether there is a\nbenefit in performing these optimizations outside the MIP solver.\nFor this part, we have disabled the pre-processing optimizer, so\nTIRESIAS always produces a single problem file. Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b\npresent the execution times of the TiQL to MIP translation, and the\nMIP solver respectively, while Fig. 6c is their sum (total runtime).\n","grouping size and dataset size. The results are presented in Fig. 7.\nLarger group sizes means that multiple partitions are grouped into a\nsingle subproblem. This results in larger MIP problem sizes, caus-\ning the MIP solver to dominate the total query runtime. Smaller\ngroups result in smaller but more problem files, causing the system\nto become I\/O bound. The graphs indicate that the choice of group\nsize results in significant differences in runtime, and the ideal group\nsize becomes larger, the larger the dataset. In its current implemen-\ntation, TIRESIAS does not pick the group size automatically, but\nthis will be an essential step in future work.\nFigure 7 demonstrates significant improvements compared to the\nresults of Fig. 6, where partitioning was deactivated. As seen in\nFig. 7f, TIRESIAS can create and solve a constrained optimiza-\ntion problem over 1M tuples in about 2.5 hours. Figure 8 offers\nadditional insight on the system scalability. The bars display the\naverage time taken by the MIP constructor and the MIP solver to\nwork on a single subproblem, when the group size is fixed to 150\npartitions. We observe that the average time the solver spends on\none problem remains fairly constant (around 1sec) for datasets of\n5k to 1M tuples. This is intuitive as the average size of the gen-\nerated subproblems is expected to be the same across the different\ndatasets, as long as the underlying statistical properties of the data\ndo not change. Of course the number of files generated will grow\nproportionally to the data size, so overall, the MIP solver runtime\nwill scale linearly.\nThe per-problem runtime of the MIP constructor time on the\nother hand does not remain constant, but increases with the data\nsize. This is because the MIP constructor retrieves all the data\nneeded to generate a subproblem by issuing several database queries\n"],"Page":10,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,282,772,339],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[85,86,765,265]}
