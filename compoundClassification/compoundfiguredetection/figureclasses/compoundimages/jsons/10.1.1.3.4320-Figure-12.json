This time, \u0018 25 milliseconds, is suited for real-\ntime use in a robot-programming environment.\nTo determine the performance of the system as a func-\ntion of model complexity, we held out one program and\ncomputed the performance on the remaining four programs.\nThe held-out program is meant as a sort of test set, but since\ndata are so sparse it is difficult to draw any statistically sig-\nnificant conclusions based on this four-program training set\nand one-program test set. Indirectly, the parameter Æ also\ndetermines the accuracy of predictions by controlling the\ncomplexity of the CDHMM. In Figure 12, we plot the av-\nerage median error on the four-program training set as a\nfunction of Æ. For all values of Æ, the angle error is ex-\ntremely small, less than 0:2 milliradians or about 0:3% of\nthe angle changed during prediction. This is because robots\ntend to change orientation in a fairly predictable manner\nduring welding and gross repositioning. By exploiting this\ninformation, the PRP system can generate extremely accu-\nrate angle predictions. However, the Cartesian movements\nof the robot are determined by the size of the objects in the\nworkspace, a much more unpredictable quantity. When the\nparameter is too small, the learning algorithm produces a\nCDHMM that is too simple to represent the user. When\nthe parameter is too large, the CDHMM begins to overfit\nthe data. In PRP, as in many machine-learning applications,\n\u201Ceverything should be made as simple as possible, but not\nsimpler\u201D and the correct complexity depends on the tasks\nat hand. In our case, the Cartesian error bottoms out on\nthe interval Æ 2 (0:5; 0:9). This implies that a value in the\nneighborhood of Æ \u0019 0:7 induces the right amount of com-\nplexity on the training set.\n"],"Page":13,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[427,398,756,429],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[437,124,748,377]}
