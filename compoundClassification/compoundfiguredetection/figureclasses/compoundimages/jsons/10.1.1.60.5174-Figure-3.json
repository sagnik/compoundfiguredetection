For the ASW method, we vary α from\n0 to 1 (in step 0.1) to change the influence of query terms\non significant word selection. The summarization results are\nlisted in Figure 1, measured by precision and ROUGE-1 re-\nspectively. When α is 0, the clickthrough data is ignored\nand only the local features of a Web page are used to se-\nlect significant words. When α is 1, only query words are\nused. For ALSA, the parameter β is also varied from 0 to 1.\nThe results are given in Figure 2. From the two figures, we\ncan find that both methods achieve significant improvements\nwhen evaluated on the manual summaries of different evalu-\nators. For ASW method, the average precision of the three\nevaluators got a relative improvement of 20.7%, from 0.29\n(when no query terms are used) to 0.35 (when query terms\nare used and α = 0.5). The average ROUGE-1 measure got\na relative improvement of 11.5% (from 0.52 to 0.58). The\nALSA method achieves a relative improvement of 12.9% and\n11.5% when measured by precision and ROUGE-1 respec-\ntively, compared with without using the clickthrough.\nOn this data set, we also evaluate our summarization\nmethods using the thematic lexicon approach. We first use\nthe ODP directory and the clickthrough data to build a\nthematic lexicon. Since the clickthrough data contains only\n260,763 pages, our lexicon contains 141,869 categories, which\nis a subset of the ODP category structure. When we summa-\nrize a page, we ignore the query words associated with it. As\ndescribed in section 3.3, the thematic lexicon is used to help\ngenerate query words. We select query terms from the lexi-\ncon based on the category of the page to be summarized. If\nterms under this category have more than P% overlap with\ndistinct terms in the Web page, then they are used for sum-\nmarization. Otherwise, we try to use lexicon terms of its\nparent category. This process continues until we find a cat-\negory which covers enough query terms or until we reach the\nroot of the thematic lexicon. In this experiment, P is em-\npirically set to 6. Evaluation results are described in Figure\n3 and Figure 4. We can find that the ASW method achieves\nan improvement of 7.8% and 5.3% measured in precision\nand ROUGE-1 respectively. The ALSA method achieves an\nimprovement of 7.6% and 6.7% when measured in precision\nand ROUGE-1 respectively.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[164,747,681,761],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[185,541,662,730]}
