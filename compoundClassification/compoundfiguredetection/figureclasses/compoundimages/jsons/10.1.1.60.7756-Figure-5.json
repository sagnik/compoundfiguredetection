This is a player\u2019s\nplay history. Since each player may progress through his\nor her game interest at a different rate, we normalize each\nof these data sets based on the duration each player is ac-\ntive on the server. We then examine the average session\ntimes and session interarrival times of all players through-\nout their playing careers. Figure 5(a) shows that player\nsession times are relatively constant halfway through their\nplay history and fall off to just more than 50% of the ini-\ntial session time before the player loses interest completely.\nFigure 5(b) shows that the time between player sessions is\nminimized before the halfway point and increases steeply\nuntil the player\u2019s interest has fully waned. The variance on\nthis data is extremely high, due in part to the fact that play-\ners only spend a portion of their time on this single server,\nand therefore this data is unsuitable for predicting the inter-\nest of a given player. However we believe this methodology\ncan be used for games with a centralized session-tracking\nauthority as an early indicator of peaking player interest\nand that game publishers should use these measurements\nto trigger the delivery of new content or incentives for the\nindividual player.\n","As a way of validating that the Steam data and the Game-\nSpy data are tracking the same thing (i.e. player load), we\nconsider a week without a Steam update. Figure 15 shows\na scatter plot of Steam data (in megabits per second) versus\nGameSpy data (in players), and the least-squares fit line.\nThe correlation coefficient for this week is 0.86, indicating\na roughly linear relationship. We attribute the inexact na-\nture of the correspondence to small changes in the size of\nthe authentication module and sampling error.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[274,688,598,702],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[145,412,731,673]}
