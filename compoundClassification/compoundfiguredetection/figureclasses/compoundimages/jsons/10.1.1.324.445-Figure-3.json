This database consists of\n2,414 frontal-face images of 38 individuals. The image size\nis 192 × 168. We randomly selected 20 subjects, half of\nwhose images are used for training (32 images per subject),\nand the other half for testing. There are a total of 640 im-\nages from the 20 subjects for training. In the identification\nexperiment, there are 640 images for testing. In the verifi-\ncation experiment, there are 1198 test images, half of which\nare true outliers.\nAll images are aligned and normalized in the Extended\nYale B database. To evaluate the identification performance\nof the proposed approach, we generated shifted test images\naccording to different shift values. For example, if the shift\nvalue is 7, each test image is shifted with random parame-\nters between 0 and 7 pixels in both horizontal and vertical\ndirections. The training images are kept unchanged. For\nfair comparison, the implementations of the Randomfaces\nalgorithm and the proposed algorithm use the same param-\neters as those introduced in [21] (random projection matrix\nnumber is l = 5, error distortion ε = 0.05, and the re-\nduced dimension d is 504). Figure 3(a) shows the recog-\nnition performance of the proposed algorithm and the Ran-\ndomfaces algorithm, as a function of shift values. One can\nsee that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Random-\nfaces algorithm. When the shift value is smaller than 2 pix-\nels, our results are slightly better than Randomfaces. When\n","with subject i keep unchanged and others are set as zeros.\nWe plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve\naccording to different σ values in Figure 3(b). As expected,\nthe proposed algorithm outperforms Randomfaces.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[114,465,351,478],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[72,329,398,460]}
