{"Caption":"Figure 1. Topic deltas and observed message deltas for email (a) and news data (b). Note how observed deltas are dominated by bursts in a single topic. Observed deltas in (b) look almost uniform, despite strong bursts in topic intensities. Explicit (but intractable) data association model (c) capturing the intensity-driven generative process. We observe t-th message from the distribution over N words and ∆t , the elapsed time from the last received email. We have                                  (k) K topics, each with intensity Lt at time t. Ct is the topic indicator, τt stores the time of last email of each topic.
