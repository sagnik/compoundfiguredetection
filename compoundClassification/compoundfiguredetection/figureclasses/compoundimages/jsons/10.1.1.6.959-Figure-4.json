We used the Reuters-\n21578 dataset. This dataset contains about 10, 000 docu-\nments. Each document in the corpus is labeled by zero or\nmore topics from a predefined set. We represented the doc-\numents using the standard vector-space model with length-\nnormalized tfidf after selecting 500 words (Singhal et al.,\n1996). Of the entire set of topics we chose 13 topics to\nuse in our experiments. The topics were chosen such that\nthe number of relevant documents is much smaller than the\nnumber of irrelevant documents for the topic. (The ratio\nbetween the number of relevant and irrelevant documents\nwas in the range [0.1, 0.01]). We then evaluated POLA\nand various online algorithms on the task of online docu-\nment filtering as follows. On each time step, we calculated\nthe distance between a new instance to all of the relevant\ndocuments observed thus far. If the distance to the closest\nrelevant document was less than the current threshold we\npredicted that the document is relevant. Otherwise, we pre-\ndicted that it is irrelevant. To evaluate the performance of\nthe algorithms we calculated both the average number of\nfalse positives (relevant) and the average number of false\nnegatives (irrelevant). We then took the average of these\ntwo errors. The end results is an equalized error estimate\nthat does not depend on the density of relevant document.\nWe compared the results of POLA to the results obtained\nby the Perceptron algorithm (Rosenblatt, 1958), the PAUM\nalgorithm (Li et al., 2002) (a variant of the Perceptron),\nand a simple 1NN classifier that uses on each round the\ndocuments observed so far. The results are given in Fig. 4.\nAs can be seen from the scatter plot in the right, POLA\n"],"Page":8,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[75,178,401,207],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[73,80,406,162]}
