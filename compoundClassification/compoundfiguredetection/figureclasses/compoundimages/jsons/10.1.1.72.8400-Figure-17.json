The leapfront distance determines\nwhen a client is allowed to play the role of a frontrun-\nner depending on how far ahead from the \u0002le cursor the\nclient cursor has moved. For convenience, we introduce\nthe leapfront factor as the ratio of the leapfront distance\nover the active length. In Figure 17, we notice that as the\nleapfront factor grows larger than 1, the network through-\nput drops and themiss ratio increases. Setting the leapfront\ndistance equal to the active length gives good perfor-\nmance by allowing the active region to move smoothly\nforward; larger leapfront distances tend to reduce spa-\ntial locality among different clients and lead to lower\nthroughput. The active length was set equal to 16MB\nthroughout our study.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":17,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[433,600,750,657],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[435,410,755,592]}
