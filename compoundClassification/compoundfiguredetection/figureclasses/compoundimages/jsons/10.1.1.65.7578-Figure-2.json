Figures 2 and 3 show the voltages\nat the nodes of interest during the rising and falling transitions of\nthe degraded inverter. The bold traces show the voltage transitions\nunder nominal conditions while the lighter curves are the result of\nincreasing amounts of wearout.\n","Igd leakage (Figures 3a and 2a), and the current conducted by the\nPMOS and NMOS devices in the inverter are significantly altered.\n","The significantly reduced output range eventually results in func-\ntional failure when the device is no longer capable of driving sub-\nsequent stages. Note however, that prior to circuit failure, the stage\nimmediately following the inverter under test is able to completely\nrestore the signal to a full rail swing (Figures 2c and 3c), irrespec-\ntive of the switching direction.\n","leakage. Unable to switch from rail-to-rail, the on-currents sus-\ntainable by the PMOS and NMOS are significantly reduced, which\nultimately contributes to the increase in overall propagation delay\n(Figure 2c).\nPerhaps more surprising is the behavior of the propagation delay\nduring a falling transition of the inverter output (Figure 3). With\nincreasing oxide degradation, the delay of the inverter actually de-\ncreases until just prior to functional failure. This behavior is caused\n","Dynamic environmental variations, such as temperature spikes,\npower surges, and clock jitter, can each have an impact on circuit-\nlevel timing, potentially affecting the operation of the WDU. Here,\nwe briefly discuss some of the sources of dynamic variation and\ntheir impact on the WDU\u2019s efficacy.\nTemperature is a well known factor in calculating device delay,\nwhere higher temperatures typically increase the response time for\nlogic cells. Figure 12 demonstrates the increase in response time\nfor a selection of logic gates2 over a wide range of temperatures.\nThis figure shows that over an interval of 50oC, the increase in\nresponse time amounts to approximately 3.4%.\nAnother source of variation is clock jitter. In general, there are\nthree types of jitter: absolute jitter, period jitter, and cycle-to-cycle\njitter. Of these, cycle-to-cycle jitter is the only form of jitter that\nmay potentially affect the WDU. Cycle-to-cycle jitter is defined as\nthe difference in length between any two adjacent clock periods and\nmay be both positive (cycle 2 longer than cycle 1) or negative (cycle\n2 shorter than cycle 1). Statistically, jitter measurements exhibit a\nrandom distribution with a mean value approaching zero [40].\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,660,772,688],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[449,74,763,646]}
