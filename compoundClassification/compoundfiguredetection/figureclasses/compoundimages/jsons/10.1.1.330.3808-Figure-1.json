Selection scheme 3\nis seen to have the lowest aggregate rate and the highest\nnormalized delay, as it does not consider node density and\nload condition in node selection. Scheme 2, although out-\nperforms scheme 3, loses to scheme 1 in both aggregate data\nrate and normalized delay as it can not fully adapt to the\ntraﬃc demands of nodes. By considering the active node\ndensity and traﬃc load in a neighborhood to reduce colli-\nsion and delay, selection scheme 1 is seen to achieve more\nthan 60% higher aggregate rate at the highest node density\nstudied while reducing the delay up to 90%.\n(2) Performance of DSA\nIn Section 7.2, the number of streams allocated is adap-\ntively adjusted according to the traﬃc condition in the neigh-\nborhood. To demonstrate its advantage, we implement an\nalternative of DSA where the number of streams allocated is\nﬁxed. The number of streams is ﬁxed to diﬀerent values in\nthe simulation. The performance of DSA and the alternative\nscheme is illustrated in Figure 2.
