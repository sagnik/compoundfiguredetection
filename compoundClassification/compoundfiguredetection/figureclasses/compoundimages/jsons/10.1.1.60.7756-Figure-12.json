Figure 12 shows, workloads for web and on-line\ngames share similar daily periodic peaks. This particular\nweek of game traffic does not have a strong weekend rise\n(perhaps due to being from the summer), but the web traffic\ndoes slump during the weekends as Figures 12(a) and 12(b)\nshow. Interestingly, Half-life shows considerably less vari-\nance than the North American websites, but similar vari-\nance to the international beverage manufacturer website.\nIntuitively, it makes sense that applications and web sites\nwith global usage patterns are more consistently busy and\nhave less daily variance. Due to the international popularity\nof Half-Life, its usage pattern is quite similar to that of the\n","ble 4 shows, a significant portion of the load is from outside\nof North America. Using the resolved connections, the per-\ncontinent load normalized by the mean connection arrival\nrate was plotted. As Figure 13 shows, each continent shows\na predictable, diurnal pattern of activity with the only dif-\nference being a time-zone shift. It is interesting to note that\nin contrast to the Half-Life aggregate load and international\nbeverage company web site load (Figure 12(c)), the per-\ncontinent load of cs.mshmro.com exhibits a large vari-\nance similar to the North American web site loads shown\nin Figures 12(a) and 12(b). We hypothesize that when the\nusage patterns of international services are broken out into\nindividual regions, the resulting load variances are similar\nto those of regional servers such as the cereal manufacturer\nand the credit card company.\n"],"Page":11,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[204,327,670,341],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[108,102,785,312]}
