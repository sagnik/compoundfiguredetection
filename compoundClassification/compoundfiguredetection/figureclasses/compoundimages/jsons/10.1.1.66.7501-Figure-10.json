When the number\nof peers increases from 27 to 214, the number of involved\nnodes and search messages for SSP go up rather slowly, out-\nperforming DSL in an increasing order of magnitude. For\nthe anti-correlated dataset, Figure 10 demonstrates that the\ncosts for both SSP and DSL follow approximately a linear\ncurve, yet the involved nodes for SSP are only half of the in-\nvolved nodes for DSL, and the search messages for SSP are\nbetween one quarter and half of the messages for DSL. The\nreduced number of involved nodes and search messages for\nSSP are due to our approaches of delimiting skyline search\nspace and forwarding a query within the partitioned search\nsubspaces.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[444,395,741,426],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[502,113,683,386]}
