BMLS uses piecewise, continuous linear splines, while\nBMARS uses tensor products of univariate splines; both are fit via reversible jumpMCMC.\nWe use three datasets, the first a function with two inputs [14] (Figure 1b), for which we use\n225 training inputs and test on 225 inputs, for each of 50 simulated datasets. The second\nis a real dataset of air temperature as a function of latitude and longitude [17] that allows\nassessment on a spatial dataset with distinct variable smoothness. We use a 109 observation\nsubset of the original data, focusing on the Western hemisphere, 222.5◦ − 322.5◦ E and\n62.5◦S-82.5◦N and fit the models on 54 splits with 107 training examples and two test\nexamples and one split with 108 training examples and one test example, thereby including\neach data point as a test point once. The third is a real dataset of 111 daily measurements\nof ozone [18] included in the S-plus statistical software. The goal is to predict the cube root\nof ozone based on three features: radiation, temperature, and wind speed. We do 55 splits\nwith 109 training examples and two test examples and one split of 110 training examples\nand one test example.
