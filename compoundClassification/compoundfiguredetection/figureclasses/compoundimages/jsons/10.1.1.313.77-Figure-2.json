For any given graph and coupling type, we performed simulations for\nsample sizes n scaling as n = 10βd log(p), where the control parameter β ranged from 0.1\nto upwards of 2, depending on the graph type.\nFigure 2 shows results for the 4-nearest-neighbor grid model, illustrated in Figure 1(a),\nfor three different graph sizes p ∈ {64, 100, 225}, with mixed couplings (panel (a)) and\nattractive couplings (panel (b)). Each curve corresponds to a given problem size, and cor-\nresponds to the success probability versus the control parameter β. Each point corresponds\nto the average of N = 200 trials. Notice how despite the very different regimes of (n, p)\nthat underlie each curve, the different curves all line up with one another quite well. This\nfact shows that for a fixed degree graph (in this case deg = 4), the ratio n\/ log(p) controls\nthe success\/failure of our model selection procedure, consistent with the prediction of The-\norem 1. Figure 3 shows analogous results for the 8-nearest-neighbor lattice model (d = 8),\nfor the same range of problem size p ∈ {64, 100, 225}, as well as both mixed and attractive\ncouplings. Notice how once again the curves for different problem sizes are all well-aligned,\nconsistent with the prediction of Theorem 1.\nFor our last set of experiments, we investigated the performance of our method for a\nclass of graphs with unbounded maximum degree d. In particular, we constructed star-\nshaped graphs with p vertices by designating one node as the spoke, and connecting it to\nd < (p−1) of its neighbors. For linear sparsity, we chose d = ⌈0.1p⌉, whereas for logarithmic\nsparsity we choose d = ⌈log(p)⌉. We again studied a triple of graph sizes p ∈ {64, 100, 225}\nand Figure 4 shows the resulting curves of success probability versus control parameter\nβ = n\/[10d log(p)]. Panels (a) and (b) correspond respectively to the cases of logarithmic\nand linear degrees. As with the bounded degree models in Figure 2 and 3, these curves\nalign with one another, showing a transition from failure to success with probability one.\n"],"Page":18,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[171,451,728,477],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[173,193,729,452]}
