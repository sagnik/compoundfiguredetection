For gaps due to the reason 2, we assume that a node status\ndoes not change during those gaps.\nWe have also analyzed Planet-Lab all-pair-ping measurements for seven months starting from April\n2004 to strengthen the conclusions we have drawn in the main study. In table 1, we present the distribution\nof unique gaps across the nodes in the system. We list all gaps observed for all nodes and compute the\ndistribution of those gaps. We found 163 unique different gaps in the PL trace and have observed that\nseven of those gaps occur in all nodes\u2019 data (about 350 nodes). Remaining 157 gaps correspond to those\ngaps that have occured at individual nodes due to the first reason.\nWe have found that the four principles we deduce still hold in the seven month dataset. Below, we\npresent the results of our analysis with the seven-month data from Planet-Lab answering the four questions\nthat we pose in the Section 1. Figure 23 shows the relationship of Availability with MTTF and MTTR for all\nnodes in the trace. Here also, we observe that among 27%(26%) of all possible pairs of machines, the one\nwith higher availability does not have higher MTTF(lower MTTR, respectively) in the trace. In Figure 24,\nwe plot the MTTR and MTTF for individual machines and again we observe a small correlation between\nthose two metrics (r =−0.07).\nIn Figures 25 and 26, we present the analysis of TTF and TTR of all machines for the seven-month trace\nin a similar way as in [8]. We again observe that exponential fits the observed data than Pareto distribution\nand hence get to same conclusion. We plot the coefficient of variance in TTF and TTR in Figure 27.
