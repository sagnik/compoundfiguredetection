All the reported\npoints are the average of 10 measurements with standard de-\nviations less than 10% of the averages or less than 1 second.\nThe experiments join a 1.5GB build relation with a 3GB\nprobe relation by producing 31 intermediate partitions for\nboth relations. Tuples are 100 bytes long. Figure 9(a) shows\nthe partition phase performance for the build relation, and\nFigure 9(b) shows the join phase performance of joining all\nthe build and probe partitions.\nThe \u0002gures vary the number of disks used and report\nthe total elapsed time for the operations, the maximum I\/O\nstall time of all the background worker threads, and the stall\ntime of the main thread waiting for workers. The worker\nI\/O stall time shows the time to \u0002nish all the I\/Os in back-\nground, which decreases dramatically as the number of disks\nincreases. With four or more disks, hash join is clearly CPU-\nbound: the total elapsed time becomes \u0003at, and the main\nthread spends less than 10% of the total time waiting for\nworker threads. Since there are typically 10 disks per pro-\ncessor on a balanced DB server, we expect that hash join is\nCPU-bound in a large number of real-world systems.\nMoreover, the large gap between the top and the middle\ncurves highlights the opportunity for dramatically reducing\nthe total time by improving the CPU performance, e.g., a 3-\nfold potential improvement when there are 6 disks.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,275,776,291],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,98,777,266]}
