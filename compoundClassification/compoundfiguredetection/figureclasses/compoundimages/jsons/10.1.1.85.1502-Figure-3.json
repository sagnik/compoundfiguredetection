How-\never, the simulations in Section 7\u2014specifically, Figure 3 (right)\u2014\ndemonstrate that the absence of SSI can be ameliorated with even\na moderately sized initial set of participants. By contrast, in Fig-\nure 2 (middle), as fairness (lower bounded by β) decreases, the\neffectiveness of the lottree also decreases. (This is not as apparent\nin the curves for small values of δ, because for small δ, Pachira\nsatisfies ϕ-VPC for ϕ≫ β.)\nThe Pachira scheme also fails to satisfy ZVR, as does the Luxor\nscheme. This turns out to be unavoidable for both.\n","A key question for an executive who wishes to use a lottree\nfor system deployment is how much money to offer as a payout.\nThe answer is a function of the desired penetration and the ex-\npected effort of sending solicitations and of joining the system.\nFigures 3 (left) and (middle) show how the penetration depends\non the selected payout, the JTC and STC. As an example, to obtain\n100K participants in a system with a STC of 30 seconds and a JTC\nof 30 minutes, Figure 3 (left) shows that we should offer a payout\nof 5000 dollars.\n","In the sensitivity analysis of Section 7.2.6, we will show that a\nPachira lottree\u2019s penetration is not significantly affected by vary-\ning the solicitation assumption factor SAF, which indicates that the\nabsence of SSI is not a critical weakness for Pachira. However,\nSAF does have an impact on lottree deployment; specifically, the\nSSI property can be violated when the lottree is very small, so low\nvalues of SAF can lead to stunted deployment that never exceeds a\nsmall factor over the initial set size.\nFigure 3 (right) shows the probability of stunting with different\nvalues of SAF and different sizes of IS. What we see is that the\nprobability of achieving sustained growth becomes unity for a suf-\nficiently large initial set. At an initSize of 20, no run was ever\nstunted. What is particularly interesting to observe is that the criti-\ncal initial set size required to guarantee sustained growth crucially\ndepends on the given SAF. The higher this value, the higher partic-\nipants weigh their marginal perceived gain in terms of WSI rather\nthan SSI, the smaller an IS suffices. In the extreme case in which\nSAF equals one, stunting never occurs.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[110,443,735,455],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[77,274,770,442]}
