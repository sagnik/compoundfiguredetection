We\nconducted experiments on random graphs, with problem in-\nstances generated as described in Section . Figure 3 shows\nthe results on graphs with \u001F\u0010\t\n\u0019\nand \u001F\u0010\t2\" using 2 col-\nors, and Figure 4 the results on graphs with \u001F*\t0\" using 4\nand 5 colors. Each data point is an average of 1,000 random\ninstances. The solution quality is also measured after 1,000\nsteps of executions. As all the figures show, the phase tran-\nsitions on random graphs have similar patterns as those on\ngrids. Therefore, the discussions on the grids apply in prin-\nciple to random graphs. We need to mention that on graphs,\nthe most aggressive algorithms, DSA-D and DSA-E, do not\nperform very well under all degrees of parallel executions.\nThis, combined with the results on grids, leads to the con-\nclusion that DSA-D and DSA-E should not be used.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[442,371,764,414],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[455,260,763,372]}
