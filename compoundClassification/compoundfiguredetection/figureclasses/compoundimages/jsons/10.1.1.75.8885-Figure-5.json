The real Web site we used is the \nStanford Web site from a September 2002 crawl6 that \nconsists of 281903 Web objects. Note, that the network \ntopologies, client populations and request stream \ngeneration are the same as with synthetic data. \nOur experiment demonstrates the average response \ntime for both network topologies. The results are reported \nin Figure 5. As previous, the x-axis represents the cache \nsize of CDN\u2019s surrogate servers, while the y-axis \nrepresents the average response time. Notice that in this \nexperiment we use a different scale for the cache sizes \n(compared with the previous ones) due to the large \namount of objects of the Stanford Web site. From this \nFigure, it can be seen that the il2p has quite similar \nperformance with lat-cdn and Random. On the other \nhand, the il2p outperforms the Popularity approach. The \nonly exception is when the surrogate servers have very \nsmall cache sizes, where the Popularity has the best \nperformance. Another observation that we make is that \nthe response times are too small. The reason is that the \n"],"Page":8,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[86,868,391,898],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[82,567,382,867]}
