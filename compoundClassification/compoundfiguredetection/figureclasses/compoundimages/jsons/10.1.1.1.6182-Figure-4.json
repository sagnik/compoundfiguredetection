Using this figure one can see, for example, that\nwhen the diagonal weights are only 8 times larger than non-\ndiagonal weights, then there areM = 40%N states stored\nin the network, and for such number of stores patterns, the\nnetwork can associatively retrieve them from as much as\nR=18% of corruption (N = 500, D = 0.15 in the figure).\n","of weights, are rescaled to the values between 0 and 255, for\nbetter viewing. By looking at the image of this matrix and\nusing Figure 4 described in the previous section, one can an-\nalytically estimate how much available memory is left and\nhow good the associative retrieval will be (the more notice-\nable the diagonal of the matrix, the worse the associative\nproperty of the memory). In addition, the figure shows the\namount of image correction measured as the Hamming dis-\ntance (79 in this case) between the visual stimulus presented\nto the network and the associative response of the network,\nand the number of iterations (2 in this case) taken by net-\nwork to make the association.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[79,811,410,941],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[82,671,404,796]}
