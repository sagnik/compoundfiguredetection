"Mention":["Grids We generated problem instances of grids with vari-\nous sizes as described in Section . Figure 1 shows the total\nnumbers of constraint violations after 1,00 steps of the al-\ngorithms using two colors on \u0013\u0018\u0007*\u0015\u0017\u0013\u0014\u0007 grids with \u001F&\t\n\u0019\n(Figure 1(left)) and \u001F'\t#\" (Figure 1(right)). Each data point\nof the figure is averaged over 1,000 random initial colorings.\nNote that the results from larger grids, such as \u0019 \u0007+\u0015 \u0019 \u0007 grids,\nfollow almost identical patterns as in Figure 1.\n","A coloring problem becomes easier if more colors are\nused, since it is less constrained to find a satisficing color\nin the next step. However, the phase-transition behavior per-\nsists even when the number of colors increases. Figure 2\nshows the results on grids with \u001F%\t.\" using 4 and 5 colors.\nNotice that the curves in the 4-color figure and the curves\nfor 3 colors (not shown here) follow similar patterns as in\nthe case for 2 colors in Figure 1(right).\n","The figures show that DSAs\u2019 phase-transition behavior is\ncontrolled by the degree of parallelism, except DSA-A on\ngrids with \u001F,\t\n\u0019\n. The transitions are typically very sharp.\nFor example, as Figure 1(left) shows, the solution quality\nof DSA-B and DSA-C decreases abruptly and dramatically\nwhen the probability \r increases above 0.8. More impor-\ntantly and surprisingly, after the transition, the solution qual-\nity is even worse than a random coloring. The average so-\nlution quality of random colorings corresponds to the point\n\r-\t.\u0007 on the DSA-B and DSA-C curves in the figure. This\nindicates that the degree of parallel executions should be\ncontrolled under a certain level in order for the algorithms to\nhave a good performance. Furthermore, the transitions start\nearlier for DSA-D and DSA-E. Although DSA-A, the most\nconservative algorithm, does not show phase transitions on\ngrids of \u001F!\t \u0019 , its average solution quality is much worse\nthan that of DSA-B, because it may be easily trapped in local\nminima.\n","The degree of parallelism and the constrainedness of the\nunderlying network structures also interplay. Grids with\n\u001F\/\t\n\u0019\nare 2-colorable while grids with \u001F\u0016\t0\" are not, and\nare thus overconstrained. The results shown in Figure 1 in-\ndicate that the phase transitions appear sooner on overcon-\nstrained problems than on underconstrained problems.

The anytime performance of DSA on\ngraphs have similar behavior as that on grids.\nIn summary, a balance between the inherited aggressive-\nness of a DSA algorithm and its degree of parallelism must\nbe maintained in order to achieve a good anytime perfor-\nmance as well as a good final solution quality.
