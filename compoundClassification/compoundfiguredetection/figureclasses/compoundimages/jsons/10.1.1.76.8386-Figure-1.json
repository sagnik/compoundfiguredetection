{"Caption":"Figure 1: The problem results. For each domain we show the results of the problems solved (with later problems within the domain having increasing difﬁculty). The top graph shows the quality of the solutions found and the bottom graph shows the time taken to ﬁnd the solutions for each of our approaches.
