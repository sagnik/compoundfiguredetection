can lead to the second problem encountered by\ntypical parameter optimisation approaches, dubbed over-\ntuning (Birattari 2004): the unfortunate situation where\nadditional tuning actually impairs test performance. This\nis analogous to over-fitting in supervised machine learning,\nwhich can lead to arbitrarily poor test results. In an earlier\nstudy, Birattari (2004) could only demonstrate a very small\nover-tuning effect using an extremely large number of 109\npseudo-runs; his analysis was qualitative, and he did not\nsuggest a solution to the problem. We demonstrate that\nover-confidence and over-tuning can in fact severely impair\nthe performance of parameter optimisation methods (see\nFigures 1(a) and 1(b)) and introduce a variant of ParamILS\nthat provably does not suffer from these effects.\n","for training, leading to 100 training and 100 test perfor-\nmance measurements for each time step; Figure 1(a) shows\nthe median, 10% and 90% quantiles of these. Training and\ntest performance diverge, and especially in the 90% quantile\nof test performance we see evidence for over-tuning. The\nsame over-tuning effect occurs for CALIBRA(1).\nFocusedILS avoids the problem of over-tuning gracefully\nby performingmore runs for promising parameter configura-\ntions: after ten seconds, its training performance for SAPS-\nQWH is virtually identical to its test performance. One may\nexpect this to come at the cost of slow movement through\nconfiguration space, but as we demonstrate in Figure 1(b),\nthis is not the case: FocusedILS starts its progress as quickly\nas BasicILS(1), but also always performs better than Basic-\nILS(10) and BasicILS(100).\nWe further studied whether a parameter setting tuned for\nan easy subclass (SW-GCP-saps) of a fairly homogeneous\nproblem class (SW-GCP) can lead to good performance on\nthe entire class. Figure 1(c) shows that in our particular\nexample, automatically tuned parameters for SW-GCP-saps\n(found by FocusedILS in one hour) drastically outperform\nthe SAPS default setting for the entire set, with speedups up\nto four orders of magnitude. This is an extremely encourag-\ning result for automatic parameter tuning on homogeneous\ninstance classes.\nFinally, ParamILS was used by Thachuk et al. to tune a\nreplica exchange Monte Carlo algorithm for protein struc-\nture prediction (Thachuk, Shmygelska, & Hoos 2007) and\nachieved performance improvements of about 50%. It was\nalso applied to several solvers submitted to the 2007 SAT\nCompetition, where it achieved a speedup of about an order\nof magnitude for SAPS on random instances and a 50-fold\nspeedup for tuning a new state-of-the-art tree search algo-\nrithm on SAT-encoded software verification problems (Hut-\nter et al. 2007).\n"],"Page":6,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,260,775,327],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[86,70,758,251]}
