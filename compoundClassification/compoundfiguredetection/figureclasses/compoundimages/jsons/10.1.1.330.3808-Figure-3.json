outperforms its alternative by providing signiﬁcantly\nhigher data rate and lower packet drop rate. As the node\ndensity increases, data rate for the alternative scheme re-\nduces. Moreover, the rate is lower when the ﬁxed stream is\nset at a larger number as it leads to severe collisions.\n(3) Performance of DMUMSS\nThe overall performance of DMUMSS is evaluated in Fig-\nure 3, with CMUMSS, CSUMSS and DSUMSS as references.\nAccording to Figure 3 (a), the aggregate rates of DMUMSS\nand CMUMSS are close, but the rate of DMUMSS is more\nthan double that of CSUMSS and almost eight times of the\nrate of DSUMSS. This demonstrates that the data rate can\nbe greatly increased in a meshed network through many-\nto-many cooperative transmissions by fully exploiting mul-\ntiuser diversity and spatial diversity. Moreover, as the num-\nber of nodes in the network increases, the data rates of both\nCMUMSS and DMUMSS increase, while the data rate of\nCSUMSS saturates at a maximum value and the rate of\nDSUMSS even decreases, as it cannot fully take advantage\nof the multiuser diversity to achieve higher rate. Figure 3(b)\nillustrates the changing of data rate with varied number of\nantenna elements. Again, data rate of MUMSS increases\nalmost linearly. In comparison, limited by the single user\nconstraint, the increasing of data rate of SUMSS slows down\nas the number of antennas grows. In Section 4.1, we have\nmentioned overload factor α, which allows more streams\nto be correctly decoded than the number of antenna ele-\nments at receiver nodes. The impact of factor α is stud-\nied in Figure 3(c). SUMSS can not take advantage of the\nhigher decoding capability to improve data rate, since only\ninterference-free one-to-one communication is allowed in a\nneighborhood, and the number of streams transmitted be-\n"],"Page":10,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,259,772,287],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[81,99,755,257]}
