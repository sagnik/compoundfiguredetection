can be improved because the TCP \nthroughput is roughly TCP send buffer size divided \nby RTT, and the connections among proxies have \nshorter RTTs comparing to the RTT between the \nuser and the application.  The throughput effect can \nbe seen for large requests (e.g. 1MB shown in \nFigure 6). \n","1. Proxy network improves connection set up time. \nAs described in Section 4.1 (see Figure 7), there \nare established TCP connections among proxies.  \nFor each virtual connection between a user and the \napplication, instead of establishing a long TCP \nconnection from the user to the application, two \nshorter TCP connections are established: one from \nthe user to the edge proxy, and the other from the \ncorresponding application proxy to the application.  \nBoth of them have small RTT (round trip time), \nsince application proxies are close to the \napplication, and users choose edge proxies based \non proximity.  Since the TCP handshake [23] takes \n1.5 RTT, the connection setup cost can be reduced \nby one RTT between the user and the application2.  \nThis effect is prominent for small requests (e.g. \n1.5KB) as shown in Figure 6. \n","2. The TCP connections among proxies are persistent, \nand in most cases the TCP congestion windows for \nthose connections have already been fully opened \nby previous data transfers and other users\u2019 traffic.  \nThus, they no longer suffer a slow start phase [23] \nto grow the congestion window.  For requests of \nmodest sizes (e.g. 100KB shown in Figure 6), this \neffect is most prominent.  \n","Proxy network scaling results are shown in Figure 15.  \nThe X-axis is the number of edge proxies in the proxy \nnetwork (they all have height 3); the Y-axis is the user-\nexperienced response time for a certain percentile of \nusers.  We can see that for up to 95 percent users, the \ncurves stay horizontal and less than 2 seconds (recall \nfrom Figure 6 that the 95 percentile performance for \ndirect application access without attacks is 2 seconds).  \nIf we define 95% users not being affected by DoS \nattacks as successful DoS resilience, then the amount of \nattack traffic can be tolerated grows linearly with the \nsize of the proxy network. \n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[480,547,707,562],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[453,101,715,535]}
