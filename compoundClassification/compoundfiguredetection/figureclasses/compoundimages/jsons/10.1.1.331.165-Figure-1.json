{"Caption":"Figure 1: Request distribution over time. The frequency of all requests, read requests, and write requests are plotted over time. Figure 1(a) shows how the request distribution changes for a single week in October 2007. Here request totals are grouped in one hour intervals. The peak one hour request total for corporate is 1.7 million and 2.1 million for engineering. Figure 1(b) shows the request distribution for a nine week period between September and November 2007. Here request totals are grouped into one day intervals. The peak one day intervals are 9.4 million for corporate and 19.1 million for engineering.
