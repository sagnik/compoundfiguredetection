The distribution resulting from RL is an impulse at the\ntop of the story-quality range, illustrating that RL is solving\nquite a different problem, as it results in a handful of the\nsame stories happening repeatedly. TTD using SAS+ as a\nfallback, however, yields results consistent with our target\ndistribution: TTD:SAS+ has virtually no stories below the\ntarget cutoff of 0.55, and a nice distribution of stories above.\nIt appears that the sampling used to populate the trajectory\ntree \u0002nds pre\u0002xes common to the stories above the thresh-\nold. Solving the TTD-MDP results in a policy that keeps\nthe agents on these trajectories as long as possible; once the\nagent falls out of this space, it is not only already in a good\npart of the space, but the number of remaining trajectories\nhas been reduced enough to make a sampling search feasi-\nble and effective.\nTo better understand the effects of approximating a solu-\ntion to a TTD-MDP by sampling trajectories, we explored\na smaller story with only 9 plot points and 28 DM actions.\nFigure 3 shows a similar improvement between using the\nnull fallback action and sampling search; however, we also\nfound that varying the number of samples used to build the\ntrajectory tree has minimal effect on the resulting distribu-\ntion. In this case, increasing from 10,000 to 100,000 samples\ndid have an effect, but further increasing to 2,000,000 had no\neffect on performance. This suggests that this method may\nperform well on even larger problems.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,280,774,301],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[110,82,740,274]}
