Figure 6 shows the parallelism\nwith different thresholds, from using all files to using only\nthose that are 90% similar. The left graph shows the curve\nfor audio files, which have a high median similarity. As\na result, the available parallelism for these files does not\ndepend greatly on the threshold. The right graph shows\nthe parallelism for video files, which rely more on being\nable to find less-similar files. We choose a 10% similarity\nthreshold as a generally applicable value that does not\nimpose excess overhead.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[436,471,753,530],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[436,315,751,455]}
