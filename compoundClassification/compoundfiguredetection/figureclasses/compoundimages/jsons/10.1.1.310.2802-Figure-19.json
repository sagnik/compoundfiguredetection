The only exception is the running time compari-\nson between SQR and OSQR-M in Jena TDB in Figure 18(b).\nWe do not observe a significant difference between the two,\nin comparison to the result from 4store in Figure 8. We artic-\nulate that Jena TDB query engine implements some form of\nmerging (which is not available in 4store) and therefore the\nperformance of SQR and OSQR-M is similar in this case. Nev-\nertheless, Jena TDB has neither detection of empty rewrit-\nings, nor does it re-order predicates for efficient pruning of\nempty rewritings, and therefore the remaining figures show\nidentical trends with 4store.\nThe pleasant surprise by the difference between 4store and\nJena TDB with regard to the merger optimization reinforces\nthe importance of our store-independent design principle.\nIn summary, our ultimate solution for SPARQL query rewiring\nover multiple views, Algorithm OSQR, exhibits superior effi-\nciency and robustness in practice. Our extensive experimen-\ntal results from two popular RDF stores convincingly and\nconsistently show that OSQR has good efficiency in practice,\nfrom rewriting to the end of query execution, over tens to\nhundred of views in RDF stores with 10 million triples.\n"],"Page":13,"Number":19,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,553,772,582],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[444,417,764,552]}
