et al\u2019s data set was discussed earlier in Section 4, and was\nused in their study [10] to discover overlapping protein complexes,\nwhich were subsequently categorized into cores, modules and iso-\nforms. In addition to the good results obtained, a major highlight\nof this study was the social affinity score computations for binary\ninteractions, which indicated the likelihood of an observed inter-\naction to be valid. In this experiment, we tested if the use of h-\nconfidence could enhance these weights for effective function pre-\ndiction. Thus, we used the continuous version of the h-confidence\nmeasure, defined in Section 3.5, to transform the original weighted\ninteraction network and calculate the reliability of an edge con-\nnecting two proteins i and j on the basis of the strengths of their\ninteractions with each other or with other proteins. Similar compu-\ntations are carried out for the other transformation methods such as\np-value and common neighbor.\nThe results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(a)\nshows that h-confidence-based transformation was indeed able to\n","obtain better results under the precision-recall framework, as com-\npared to the raw weighted graph and other transformations. This\ndifference in performance between the various methods is accentu-\nated by the relative performance of the different transformations\nof the original networks when only the top 500 predictions are\nconsidered. As shown by Figures 2(b), continuous h-confidence-\nand binary h-confidence-based transformations outperform the raw\nweighted graph by a large margin. For instance, for the top 150 pre-\ndictions, a margin of 5% and 10% is observed respectively. These\nresults show the merits of using association analysis-based trans-\nformation methods for this data set.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,660,772,688],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[454,103,758,635]}
