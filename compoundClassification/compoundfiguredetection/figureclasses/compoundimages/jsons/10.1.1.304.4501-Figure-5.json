Fig. 5\npresent the comparison of f-scores for diﬀerent percentage\nof incremental using the incremental method with the batch\nmethod applied to the full data. It turns out that the perfor-\nmance of incremental method deteriorates as the incremen-\ntal data takes a large percentage. Fortunately, the f-scores\n","is because that more information is captured by the larger\ndataset with larger absolute size. On average, the deterio-\nration of recommendation quality can be signiﬁcant if the\nincremental data takes more than 30% of the data. So we\nwould suggest re-run the batch process when the updated\ncorpus exceeds the original size signiﬁcantly.\nFinally, we present the propagation of errors if the incre-\nmental update is applied to multiple times. It has come to\nour attention that the performance deteriorates at a faster\npace if one applies multiple steps of incremental updates.\nFig. 5.4 illustrates the f-scores w.r.t. diﬀerent numbers of\nsteps in the incremental updates, for diﬀerent overall per-\ncentage to update. Notice that the f-scores deteriorate faster\nif the overall percentage of update is greater. Also, the f-\nscores decrease slower at ﬁrst 1 − 2 steps and faster from\nthe 3rd step onwards. It is then suggested that the new in-\ncremental method should be used with caution, preferring\nfewer number of uses or on a larger percentage of data for\neach use. It seems that the error in the incremental updates\nis propagated more than linearly.\nThe incremental update methods presented in this sec-\ntion addresses the scalability issues in recommendation of\nlarge-scale dataset on the Web. In practice, we recommend\na combination of batch update and incremental update seek-\ning a tradeoﬀ between eﬃciency and scalability.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,312,407,369],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[90,86,379,288]}
