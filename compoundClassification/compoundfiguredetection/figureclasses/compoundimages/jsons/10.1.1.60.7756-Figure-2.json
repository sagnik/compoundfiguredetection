To further illus-\ntrate this, Figure 2(b) shows the cumulative density func-\ntion for the session times of the trace. As the figure shows,\nmore than 99% of all sessions last less than 2 hours.\nUnlike the player patience data, session times can not\nbe fitted with a simple negative exponential distribution.\nHowever, the data can be closely matched to a Weibull dis-\ntribution, a more general distribution that is often used to\nmodel lifetime distributions in reliability engineering [22].\nSince quitting the game can be viewed as an attention \u201Cfail-\nure\u201D on the part of the player, the Weibull distribution is\nwell-suited for this application. The generalized Weibull\ndistribution has three parameters β, η, and γ and is shown\nbelow.\n","Using the same trace, we extracted the total session time of\neach player session contained in the trace. Figure 2 plots\nthe session time distributions of the trace in unit increments\nof a minute 1. The figure shows, quite surprisingly, that a\nsignificant number of players play only for a short time be-\nfore disconnecting and that the number of players that play\nfor longer periods of time drops sharply as time increases.\nNote that in contrast to heavy-tailed distributions reported\nfor most source models for Internet traffic; the session ON\n","Using a probability plotting method [22], we estimated\nthe shape (β) and scale (η) parameters of the session time\nPDF. As Figure 2(a) shows, aWeibull distribution with β =\n0.5, η = 20, and γ = 0 closely fits the PDF of measured\nsession times for the trace.\nThis result is in contrast to previous studies that have\nfitted a negative exponential distribution to session-times\nof multiplayer games [23]. Unlike the Weibull distribu-\n","via their unique player identification number (WONID).\nWe quantify loyalty to the server by counting the number\nof times a player returns to play after a successful playing\nsession. Figure 4(a) shows the probability density function\nof additional game sessions per player for players who re-\nturned at least once to the server while Figure 4(b) shows,\non a logarithmic scale, the cumulative distribution. As the\nfigure shows, 42% of the players in our trace returned to\nplay only once and 81% played less than 10 times. On\nthe other hand, the top 1% of loyal gamers return to play\nhundreds of times (hence the logarithmic scale). It appears\nthat the majority of clients have very little loyalty to pub-\nlic servers, and only a small fraction have grown strongly\nattached. We hypothesize that, due to a large population of\nservers to choose from (over 30,000), clients rarely select\nthe same server twice.\n","As Figure 12 shows, workloads for web and on-line\ngames share similar daily periodic peaks. This particular\nweek of game traffic does not have a strong weekend rise\n(perhaps due to being from the summer), but the web traffic\ndoes slump during the weekends as Figures 12(a) and 12(b)\nshow. Interestingly, Half-life shows considerably less vari-\nance than the North American websites, but similar vari-\nance to the international beverage manufacturer website.\nIntuitively, it makes sense that applications and web sites\nwith global usage patterns are more consistently busy and\nhave less daily variance. Due to the international popularity\nof Half-Life, its usage pattern is quite similar to that of the\n","ble 4 shows, a significant portion of the load is from outside\nof North America. Using the resolved connections, the per-\ncontinent load normalized by the mean connection arrival\nrate was plotted. As Figure 13 shows, each continent shows\na predictable, diurnal pattern of activity with the only dif-\nference being a time-zone shift. It is interesting to note that\nin contrast to the Half-Life aggregate load and international\nbeverage company web site load (Figure 12(c)), the per-\ncontinent load of cs.mshmro.com exhibits a large vari-\nance similar to the North American web site loads shown\nin Figures 12(a) and 12(b). We hypothesize that when the\nusage patterns of international services are broken out into\nindividual regions, the resulting load variances are similar\nto those of regional servers such as the cereal manufacturer\nand the credit card company.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[273,377,601,391],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[136,98,741,362]}
