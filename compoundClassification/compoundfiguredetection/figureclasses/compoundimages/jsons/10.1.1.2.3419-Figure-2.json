The experiments were carried out on a P4 1.4GHz\nPC with 512MB memory. We generate N source points and N target points in 100 dimen-\nsional unit hypercubes using a uniform distribution. The weights on the source points are\ngenerated using uniform distribution in the interval [0, 1]. We directly evaluate the sums (4)\nas the ground truth, where σ2 = (0.5)d and d is the dimensionality of the data. Then we\nestimate it using the improved fast Gauss transform and Nystro¨m method. To compare the\nresults, we use the maximum relative error to measure the precision of the approximations.\nGiven a precision 0.5%, we use the error bound (11) to find the parameters of the IFGT,\nand use a trial and error method to find the parameter of the Nystro¨m method. Then we\nvary the number of points, N , from 500 to 5000 and plot the time against N in Figure 2\n(a). The results show the IFGT is much faster than the Nystro¨m method. We also fix the\nnumber of points to N = 1000 and vary the size of centers (or random subset) k from 10\nto 1000 and plot the results in Figure 2 (b). The results show that the errors of the IFGT are\n"],"Page":7,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,419,675,446],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[178,199,672,414]}
