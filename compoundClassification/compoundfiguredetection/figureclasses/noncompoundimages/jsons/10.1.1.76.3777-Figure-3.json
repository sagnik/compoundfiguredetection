{"Caption":"Figure 3. Eﬀect of increasing the cost of false positives for the Logistic Regression algorithm. On the x-axis is the multiplier for the false positive cost (1 represents equal FP and FN costs). The y-axis shows the fraction of AROC diﬀerence between MI\/LR and LR at FP cost=1 that is recovered as the cost changes. Thus, a value of 1 means that LR and MI\/LR have the same AROC.
