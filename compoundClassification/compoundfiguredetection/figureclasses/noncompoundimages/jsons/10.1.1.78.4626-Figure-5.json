{"Caption":"Figure 5: The simple and intermediate online tasks. The first row shows the simple task, where the robot arm starts in the middle, and the goal is to topple the two objects placed on either side. The second row shows the intermediate task, where the goal is to pick up a designated object, carry it over an obstacle, and drop it in the bin. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Task Selection:We chose 3 different tasks for our study;\nsimple, intermediate and complex. The simple task is a\ngross-movement task that only requires the subject to move\nthe robotic arm to two specific locations in succession and\nknock off objects placed there. Here the goal is to test ba-\nsic reach ability where fine control is not necessary. The in-\ntermediate task involves moving the robotic arm to a desig-\nnated object, picking it up, and carrying it over an obstacle to\na bin where it is then dropped. In this task, accurate position-\ning of the arm is important, and additional commands are\nused for grasp\/release. Figure 5 describes the first two tasks\nin more detail. The third, complex, task involves picking up\na number of pegs placed at chosen locations, and stacking\nthem in order at a designated place. This requires very fine\ncontrol of the robotic arm both for reaching and picking up\nobjects, and also for placing them carefully on the stack. Fig-\nure 6 illustrates the complex task.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[442,336,775,427],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[455,74,764,321]}
