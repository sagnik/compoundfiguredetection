We\nconducted experiments for both the deployment knowledge-based\nscheme and the basic scheme. Recall that in the basic scheme,\nwe also trim down the original Merkle tree to m sub-trees, but the\ntrimming does not consider the deployment knowledge. The exper-\niment results are depicted in Figure 6. The figure clearly shows that\nthe communication overhead decreases with the increase of mem-\nory usages. More specifically, it shows that for network size 4096,\nthe average communication overhead for the deployment knowledge-\nbased scheme is less than two hash values.
