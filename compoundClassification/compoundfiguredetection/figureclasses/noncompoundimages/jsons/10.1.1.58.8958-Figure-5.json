A projector with a resolution of 1280 \nx 1024 pixels was used to project images onto a horizontal, \n72 inch diagonal, SMART DViT board (Figures 4, 5, 6, 7). \nAlthough SMART\u2019s DViT system allows for simultaneous \ntouch detection, the technology does not currently indicate \nwhich person initiated which touch. Thus, the collaborative \ngroup task was designed so that only one person needed to \ninteract with the table at a given time.  \n","firm. Their job was to pass documents to lawyers positioned \naround the table in such a way that the receiving lawyer \ncould read the document. For each trial, the participants \npassed a document, which initially appeared upright at the \nbottom of the screen, to digital avatars located at three sides \nof the display (Figures 5 and 7(b)).  \n","Participants were free to decide which orientations satisfied \nthe readability condition and the appropriate proximity of \nthe passed document to the lawyer avatars. The lawyers at \nthe left and right positions were located approximately 535 \npixels (21.2 inches) from the original document location, \nwhile the lawyer opposite the participant was a little farther, \napproximately 630 pixels (25.0 inches). The document was \nto be passed as quickly as possible to the lawyer indicated \nby stars next to their avatar (see Figure 5).  Pressing a \n\u201CNext\u201D button advanced them to the next trial. Task 2 had \n30 trials, with 10 document passes to each of the three \nlawyers. The ordering of these passes was random.  \n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[317,257,547,299],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[317,83,550,258]}
