Five judges\nwere asked to (weakly) order all result documents\nencountered during each query chain according to\ntheir relevance to the question (Radlinski & Joachims,\n2005). From this data, we found that the inter-judge\ndisagreement in real preference constraints generated\naccording to Figure 1 is about 14%. Note that this is\na different measure than above because we are com-\nparing the preferences of two judges rather than pref-\nerences of one judge to a ground truth. This means\nthat the error rate between the ground truth and a\nhuman judge is in the range 7-14%, depending on the\nlevel of independence between the judgments of the\ntwo judges. These results tell us that the error rate in\nthe medium noise setting is likely to be realistic.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[425,967,752,995],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[452,769,716,958]}
