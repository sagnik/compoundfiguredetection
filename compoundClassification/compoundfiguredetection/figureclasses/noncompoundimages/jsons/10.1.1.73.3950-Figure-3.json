"Caption": "Figure 3: Patch Matching: The left image is sampled (red dots) by patches encoded as oriented filter channels (for one patch, four channels are shown). Each patch is matched to the best point in the other image by maximizing the appearance similarity between the patches. For each pair of patches (bi-patch), the size and color of the matching circles indicates similarity in appearance. (Larger and redder is more similar.) ",
