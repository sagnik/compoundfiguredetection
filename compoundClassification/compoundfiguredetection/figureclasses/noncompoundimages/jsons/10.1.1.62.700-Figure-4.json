To see that the lemma holds it is enough to show\nthat there\u2019s no way to draw two paths, both starting at the same point such that the resulting\ngraph has only one true collision and a cycle with alternating edge directions of length at least\nfour, we leave the verification of that to the reader. Lemma 10 is tight in the sense that we can\u2019t\nreplace the 2 with a 3 there. In figure 4 a structure graph G ∈ G(A\u2016B\u2016C,D\u2016E\u2016F ) is shown with\nthree true collisions (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1) (the edges D,E,F account for those collisions) but only two\n"],"Page":13,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[137,206,711,223],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[344,33,503,191]}
