{"Caption":"Figure 11. Hybrid Polygon-Orientation menu of breadth-24. (a) A short tap, invokes the Polygon menu. (b) A longer first stroke invokes the orientation-based menu. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We implemented two menus that hybridize our position-\nbased designs with pure orientation-based menus. The goal \nof these hybrids is to further increase menu breadth while \nproviding faster access to a small number of frequently \nused items. The key idea is to consider the length of the \nfirst stroke to decide which menu is invoked. A tap indi-\ncates that the user wishes to access an item in the position-\nbased menu, while a (longer) stroke is used to directly ac-\ncess an item in the orientation-based menu (Figures 10 and \n11)2. Since the items in the orientation-based menu do not \nrequire the initial tap they are faster to access. \n"],"Page":9,"Number":11,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[439,474,775,516],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[440,303,776,469]}
