This task \ncompared RNT and TM for a document-passing task in a \ncollaborative setting. Groups of three participants were \nresponsible for completing a word puzzle by passing and \ndecoding clues to form a completed sentence. The task \nproceeded as follows: a clue object would appear at one of \nthe three collaborator\u2019s positions (Alpha, Beta or Gamma as \nseen in Figure 6), oriented \u201Cright way up\u201D for that position. \nEach clue specified a receiver to whom the clue was to be \npassed.
