{"Caption":"Figure 12: Relationship between different cases of symmetric strokes of length 12 on a 5 × 5 grid. Enclosed (reduced) refers to the enclosed case, after removing double-counting. (Note: a stroke of length 12 implies a password of length at least 12.) ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["for a given s and e are a combination of the disjoint,\ncontinuous, and enclosed cases. When ℓ is odd, the\nsymmetric strokes enumerated for a given s and e are\na combination of the continuous and enclosed cases.\nThese sets intersect due to the nature of our counting\nmethod. In determining the size of an overall memo-\nrable password space, overlaps must be accounted for\nto avoid double-counting. Fig. 12 gives a representa-\ntive illustration of how the strokes intersect with one\nanother when ℓ is even (more specifically, ℓ = 12);\nwhen ℓ is odd, the disjoint case is void (recall §4.2).\n"],"Page":12,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[86,639,763,685],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[290,372,566,621]}
