{"Caption":"Figure 3. Cumulative probabilities of resuming work within a suspended active window as a function of minutes into the resumption phase. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We were also interested in the influence of the duration of \nthe focus of attention on tasks just prior to suspension on \nthe time until resumption. Figure 3 illustrates the results of \nthis exploration. Active windows where users spent \nbetween 5-30 minutes before the suspension were typically \nresumed within 5-15 minutes into the resumption phase. In \ncontrast, if users spent less than 5 minutes on a task before \nsuspension, they had a 10% probability of not resuming the \ntask within 2 hours into the resumption phase.  \n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[446,364,764,406],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[444,89,766,349]}
