In the Gunner program, the process that stores the location of the\ngun does not send back any acknowledgment when the move the gun operation completes.\nIn general, events can causally follow the start event of the interval but be excluded from the\ninterval. These events may be relevant to the feature, so it would be desirable to extend the strict\ninterval somewhat. However it would not be meaningful to include all events that causally follow\nea, since that would include far too many events. We wish to consider only those causally following\nevents that happen some reasonably short time after the interval.\nWe include additional relevant events by extending the weight function !() with a time decay.\nAs shown in Figure 3(b), the weight of an event decreases as time from the interval increases.
