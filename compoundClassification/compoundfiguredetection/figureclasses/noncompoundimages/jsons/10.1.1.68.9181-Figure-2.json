An example system is shown in Figure 2. The \ntraffic for individual channels is multiplexed over shared \ncommunication links by aggregating the traffic of \nmultiple streams into a single stream linking the two \ncommunicating addresses.   \n We follow the semantics of a publish-subscribe system \nin order to ensure that multiple sinks can \nsubscribe\/unsubscribe to a stream channel depending on \ntheir requirements, and that the channels survive even \nwhen there are no subscribers (although in that case no \nactual data is streamed). The publish-subscribe system \nalso proves useful when many sinks have similar data \nfiltering needs; in such a scenario, a single channel \nderived using a data transformation operator can fill the \nneeds of all the sinks.  \n The data-operator in our infrastructure is typically a \nsnippet of code written in a portable subset of C called \n\u201CE-Code\u201D.
