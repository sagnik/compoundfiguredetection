(Top left) 2D input data (drawn from blue to red with respect to time) collected from mouse movements moving up and down one moon and transitioning to move                                            Student Version of MATLAB                  Student Version of MATLAB up and down the second moon. (Top right) The resulting continuous ST-Isomap embedding (KNTN = 3), producing two loops connected by a transition. (Bottom left) Hard spatio-temporal correspondences (shown by red lines) es- tablished by ST-Isomap in the input data. (Bottom right) Distance matrix produced by ST-Isomap.
