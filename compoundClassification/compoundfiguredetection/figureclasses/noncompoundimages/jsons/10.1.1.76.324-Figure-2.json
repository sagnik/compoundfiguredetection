The main difference is that they are derived from a labeled surface\nmesh (shown in Figure 2a); each vertex of the mesh has an associated symbolic label ref-\nerencing a surface region or component in which it lies. The components are constructed\nusing a region growing algorithm to be described in Section 2.2. For symbolic surface\nsignature construction, the vector \u0000\b\u0003 in Figure 2b is projected to the tangent plane at \u0000\nwhere a set of orthogonal axes \t and \n have been defined. The direction of the \n\f\u000B\r\t axes is\narbitrarily defined since no curvature information was used to specify preferred directions.\nThis ambiguity is resolved by the methods described in Section 2.2. The discretized version\nof the \t and \n coordinates of \u0000\b\u0003 are used to index a 2D array, and the indexed position of\nthe array is set to the component label of \u0000 to be defined below. The resultant array is the\nsymbolic surface signature at point \u0000 . Note that the signature captures the relationships\namong the labeled regions on the mesh. The signature is shown as a labeled color image in\nFigure 2c.\n","c)a) b)\nFigure 2: The symbolic surface signature for point P on a labeled surface mesh model of a human\nhead. The signature is represented as a labeled color image for illustration purposes.\n","Since symbolic surface signatures are defined up to a rotation we use the virtual SV method\nfor training all the classifiers involved. The method consists of training a component detec-\ntor on the signatures to calculate the support vectors. Once the support vectors are obtained,\nnew virtual support vectors are extracted from the labeled surface mesh in order to include\nthe desired invariance; that is, a number = of rotated versions of each support vector is gen-\nerated by rotating the \n\b\u000B \t coordinate system used to construct each symbolic signature\n(see Fig. 2).\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,557,674,585],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[273,413,574,558]}
