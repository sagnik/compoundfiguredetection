The\ngraph nodes represent disk blocks and the edges connect\nblocks that are adjacent. The graph in the figure shows\ntwo levels of adjacency: the root node is the starting\nblock, the nodes in the intermediate level are adjacent\nto that block, and the nodes in the bottom level are ad-\njacent to the blocks in the intermediate level. Note that\nadjacent sets of adjacent blocks (i.e., those at the bot-\ntom level of the graph) overlap. For brevity, the graph\nshows only the first 6 adjacent blocks (i.e., d \u0000 6), even\nthough d is considerably larger for this disk, as described\nin Section 4. With the concept of adjacent blocks, ap-\nplications can lay out and access multidimensional data\nwith the existing 1D abstraction of the disk.
