Since AMCP switches chan-\nnels at the packet level, channel switching delay due to hardware\nlimitations can be a source of overhead. According to the IEEE\n802.11 specification [14] this parameter can reach 224µs. Fig.\n10 shows a graceful decrease of aggregate throughput as channel\nswitching delay increases from 0 to 5ms. At 224µs, the throughput\ndecrease is very small. This can be explained by the fact that 224\n"],"Page":8,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[486,361,724,374],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[490,178,722,345]}
