As the system is only com-\nparing the latest version on the server with the existing\nversion on the client, the volume of data to be transmit-\nted does not depend on the privacy policy. In contrast,\nthe volume of data transmitted during upload (checkin)\noperations does depend on the privacy policy employed\nbecause, at the server, redundant chunks are only identi-\nfied within that user\u2019s version history under the IP policy,\nbut can be identified acrosss all users\u2019 version histories\nunder the ALL policy. These differences based on stor-\nage policy are summarized in Figure 9 and affect our dis-\ncussion in two ways: (1) this section (Section 5.1), which\ninvestigates the effects of privacy policy, only considers\nthe upload operation, and (2) Figures 12 and 13 in Sec-\ntion 5.2 contain curves simply labeled CAS that repre-\nsent the identical download behaviors of the IP and ALL\npolicies.\n","The basic tools are the same as those mentioned for\ndemand-fetch mode. That is, a cache of at least one pre-\nvious version of the parcel is maintained at the client, if\npossible. Redundancy between the cached version and\nthe current version on the server is identified and only\nnon-redundant chunks are transferred during the down-\nload. Further, the transferred chunks are (optionally)\ncompressed prior to transmission. One difference be-\ntween our treatment of demand-fetch and complete-fetch\nis that the CAS policy for complete-fetch mode always\ncompares the entire current server version with the entire\ncached client version. Consequently, Figure 13 includes\na single \u201CCAS\u201D curve rather than the separate \u201CM\u201D and\n\u201CM+D\u201D curves of Figure 12.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[465,771,720,785],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,555,748,760]}
