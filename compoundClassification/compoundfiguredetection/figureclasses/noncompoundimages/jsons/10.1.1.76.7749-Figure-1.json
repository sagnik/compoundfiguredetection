Our main result is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for the terrain\nguarding problem in two dimensions. Our results rely on developing several geometric properties\nof terrains, in order that our algorithm can exploit the special structure.\nThe main difficulty in proving our main result is in showing that one can obtain a constant-\nfactor approximation to the dominating set problem in graphs that can be realized as the visibility\ngraph of the vertices of a terrain polygon (i.e., to the problem of placing vertex guards on a terrain\nin order to see all other vertices). It is then relatively straightforward to extend this result to apply\nto placing arbitrary guards on the terrain in order to guard all of the terrain.\nIt is worth noting that some natural and simple approaches to the problem do not yield O(1)-\napproximations: One can give examples showing a subset of vertices guarding T , without redundant\nvertices, that is arbitrarily bad with respect to optimal (see Figure 1); similarly, simple sweep\n"],"Page":3,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[122,219,726,237],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[247,28,602,201]}
