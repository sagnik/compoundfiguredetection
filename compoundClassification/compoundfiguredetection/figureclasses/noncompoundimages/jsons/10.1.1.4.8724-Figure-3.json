{"Caption":"Figure 3: The 2D analogue of our method: the projection P maps each point (or fragment) in T3 onto the 3D texture domain T3 (left). The mapping M can then be used to look up the texture information from the 2D texture domain T2 . PolyCube-Maps are not tied to the mesh structure and work for different mesh representations (right).
