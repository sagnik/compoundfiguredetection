{"Caption":"Figure 6: Belief propagation over a sequence where the pa- tient wets their hands. No prompt was given to initiate this behavior. The state distribution is shown along the top. The patients hands are initially believed to be dry and dirty at frame 359, but the observed behavior shifts the belief over hands wet towards wet. The actual task state is indicated by a star.
