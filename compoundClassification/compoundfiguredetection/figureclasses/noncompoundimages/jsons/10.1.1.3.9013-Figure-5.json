The intruder first added a new user\naccount ftp, then installed iroffer [2]. Iroffer is a pro-\ngram that enables the hostingmachine to act as a file\nserver for an IRC channel similar to the Napster file\nsharing system [3]. Once started, iroffer connected\nto an IRC server and logged into a certain channel.\nThe intruder was able to remotely re-configure irof-\nfer which would periodically report its status in the\nchannel, including available space, files, and trans-\nmission status.
