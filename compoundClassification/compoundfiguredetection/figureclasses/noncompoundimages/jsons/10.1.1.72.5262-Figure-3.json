If a week has passed since the challenge\nwas generated, it is less likely to matter whether the chal-\nlenge was fresh a few hours earlier or later. This mirrors the\ninverse relationship between entry lifetime and frequency de-\npicted in Figure 2. Thus, we expect RSS feeds to meet the\nneeds of many kinds of applications.\nIn the first policy we modeled, which we label \u201CShort,\u201D a\nderiver collects all entries from the source that are less than\none hour old, and verifiers require at least one entry in the\nderivation to match the contents of the feed. We calculated\nsatisfaction using this policy and two robustness standards,\nwhich required the policy to be verifiable a minimum of 6\nhours and 12 hours after derivation. We tested these models\nwith the Popular sources. Series A and B of Figure 3 show\nthe percentage of sources that satisfied these requirements\nat least a given fraction of the time. In all, 13% of sources\nsatisfied the 6 hour requirement at least 50% of the time, as\ndid 7% the 12 hour requirement.\nIn the second policy we modeled, which we label \u201CLong,\u201D\nderivers collect all entries from the source that are less than\none day old, and verifiers require at least one entry in the\nderivation to match the contents of the feed. We calculated\nsatisfaction using this policy and two robustness standards,\nwhich required the policy to be verifiable a minimum of 7\ndays and 14 days after derivation. We tested these models\nwith the Longtail sources. Series C and D of Figure 3 show\nthe percentage of sources that satisfied these requirements\nat least a given fraction of the time. In all, 24% of sources\nsatisfied the 7 day requirement at least 50% of the time, as\ndid 7% the 14 day requirement.\nAs these data show, not all sources are equally suitable\nfor harvesting challenges; however, a significant fraction of\nsources were able to satisfy our model requirements at least\nhalf the time. Policy creators can achieve high robustness\nby combining data from a number of such sources. If sat-\nisfaction times were uniformly distributed and uncorrelated\nbetween sources, we would need to combine 10 sources with\na suboptimal 50% satisfaction rate to reduce expected down-\ntime to less than 90 seconds a day.\nIn practice, satisfaction times were correlated and not dis-\ntributed uniformly, but policy creators will tend to select\nsources that are well suited for their policies. Here we depict\nthe satisfaction of 7 selected sources modeling the \u201CShort\u201D\npolicy with a 6 hour verifiability requirement. Each horizon-\ntal bar represents one source over the course of the week;\nshaded areas indicate times when challenges could be har-\nvested and meet these requirements. At least one of the\nsources satisfied the policy at all times during the period; at\nleast two sources satisfied the policy more than 90% of the\ntime:\n"],"Page":9,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,881,773,952],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[124,547,722,863]}
