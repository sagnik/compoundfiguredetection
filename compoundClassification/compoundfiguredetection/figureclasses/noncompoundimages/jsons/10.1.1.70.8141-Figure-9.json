{"Caption":"Figure 9: Trine and Monica have formed a group by dragging their eBag icons close together. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The eBag supports project work by allowing eBags to form\ngroups in which the distribution and sharing of material\nbecomes very easy. By dragging two or more eBag icons\nclose together, a group is formed. When doing this, a group\nname is prompted for and a shared group folder is created,\nwhich all the members of the group have access to from\ntheir eBags. The eBag icons are now assembled into a group\nicon, where each eBag icon is included. An example of this\nwhere Trine and Monica have formed a group can be seen\nin Figure 9.\nTo put the result of an assignment in the form of, e.g., a\ntext document to the eBag, the pupils can drag and drop\nfiles to an opened eBag into a specific folder in the eBag\nhierarchi. This can also be accomplished by dragging and\ndropping files directly to the eBag icons. This feature is\nalso supported by the grouped eBag icons. Thus a teacher\ncan easily delegate, e.g., new assignments or evaluations to\na whole group at once without having to open each pupil\u2019s\neBag.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,239,407,267],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[107,74,372,220]}
