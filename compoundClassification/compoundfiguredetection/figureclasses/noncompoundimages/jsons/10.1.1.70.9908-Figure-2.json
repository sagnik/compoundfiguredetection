{"Caption":"Figure 2: Clean and bio-fouled salinity time series examples from Red26 station. The upper time series is from clean instrument CT1460. The lower time series from instrument CT1448 shows degradation beginning on September 28, 2001. On removal, CT1448 was found to be bio-fouled.

When the sensor bio-\nfouls, the md salinity gradually decreases to typically less than half its normal mean\nvalue, as seen in the Figure 2 example.\n","The on-line monitor displays a bio-fouling indicator for the previous forty days of\ndata. Figure 3 shows the on-line bio-fouling monitor during incidents at the Red26\nCT1448 sensor and the Tansy Point CT1462 sensor. Since we had another sensor\nmounted at the Red26 site that did not bio-foul, Figure 2, we were able to estimate\nthe bio-fouling time as September 28th.
