Such queries attract a\ntarget market, which advertiser can exploit.\nThe description of the TREC data [Macdonald and Ounis,\n2006] provides an analysis of the posts from splogs that were\nadded to the collection. Top informative terms include \u2018in-\nsurance\u2019, \u2018weight\u2019, \u2018credit\u2019 and such. Figure 6 shows the dis-\ntribution of splogs identified by our system across such spam\nterms.
