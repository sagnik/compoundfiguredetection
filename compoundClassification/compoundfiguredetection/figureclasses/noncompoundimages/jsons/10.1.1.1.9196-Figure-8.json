{"Caption":"Figure 8: Distribution of Inverse Mean Propagation Delay (r) and Copy Probability (κ) for RSS data. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["ampDown areas. So the dataset consists of both signal and noise.\nather than introducing a \u201Creal world\u201D node to modeling communi-\nation through the general media, we restrict our attention to topics\nor which at least 90% of the occurrences are in blogspace, rather\nhan in our RSS media content. This focuses on about 7K topics.\nTo validate that the model has in fact discovered the correct\ndges, we performed two experiments. First, we downloaded the\nop 100 blogs as reported by http:\/\/blogstreet.com. Of\nhe 100 blogs, 70 of them were in our RSS-generated dataset. We\nhen used the model to rank individual nodes of the network based\nn the amount of traffic flowing through those nodes. Of the 70\nodes in our dataset, 49 were in the top 10% of blogs in our analy-\nis; 40 were in the top 5%, and 24 were in the top 1.2%.\nAs a second validation, we ranked all edges in the final model\ny the expected number of topics that flowed down the edge, and\nroduced the top 200. We hand-examined a random sample of this\net, and in 90% of the cases were able to find a link between the\nwo blogs. Note that we were able to make use of the structure of\nlogspace in the discovery of these links (i.e., blogrolls, and userids\nppearing inline), while the algorithm did not have access to these\nechanisms, and made its determinations based on topics alone.\nFigure 8 shows the distributions of r and κ as learned by the\nlgorithm on the approximately 7K topics described above. Most\ndges have an expected propagation delay (1\/r) of fewer than 5\n"],"Page":9,"Number":8,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,308,774,336],"Height":1169,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[459,77,757,299]}
