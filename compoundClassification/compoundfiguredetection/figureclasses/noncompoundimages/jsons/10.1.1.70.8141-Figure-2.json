As the groups members approach the display their\neBags emerge. They gather relevant background material\nfrom the Internet concerning their specific topic as seen in\nFigure 1. When the group is done preparing they collect all\ntheir material in the shared project folder of the eBag and\nset out to visit the different locations in the city. As they\nleave their eBags disappear from the display.\nThe pupils are equipped with mobile phones capable of\ntaking pictures as well as making audio and video recordings.\nThey visit different parts of the city, interviewing museum\ncustodians and local business vendors and taking pictures\nof streets and building as they look today. As interviews\nand recordings are made these are saved directly from the\nphone into the eBag. Such an interview session could look\nlike presented in Figure 2.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,796,772,809],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,640,772,767]}
