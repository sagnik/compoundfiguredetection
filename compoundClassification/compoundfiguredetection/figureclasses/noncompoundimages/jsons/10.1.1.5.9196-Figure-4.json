{"Caption":"Figure 4. First person view of arena and pole that the user experienced while performing the tasks. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Each trial in the test consisted of two phases, the encoding \nphase and the return-to-origin phase. In the encoding phase, \nwe led users along the first two legs of a triangle (see Fig-\nure 3). For each leg, they saw a pole at the next vertex of \nthe triangle (see Figure 4). Their task was to turn and move \nto each successive pole. Users could only turn when they \nwere standing at a vertex. Additionally, they could only \nmove forward and backward in straight lines, and only \nwhile they were facing the next vertex. This prevented users \nfrom straying off the defined path. Upon getting to the last \nvertex, users began the return-to-origin phase. In this phase, \nthe poles disappeared and users had to use the joystick to \nturn and move to the origin, using only the mental map they \nhad constructed and the visual cues provided by the envi-\nronment. Again, users could only turn when they were at \nthe vertex. However, since they could move forward and \nbackward, they could return to the vertex to adjust their \nresponse angle if they felt that it was not correct. They \npressed the trigger on the joystick to indicate their answer \nwhen they were done navigating. \n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[460,964,755,997],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[438,722,778,963]}
