The number of routing trees built, T, is related \nto server clique size as shown in Figure 6: if a clique has more \nthan T servers, multiple servers have to join the same tree. As \na result, subscription information for this tree is replicated on \nall these servers, reducing the effectiveness of local content \nspace partitioning.
