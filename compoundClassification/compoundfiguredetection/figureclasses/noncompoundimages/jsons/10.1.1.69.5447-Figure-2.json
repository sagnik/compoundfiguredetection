{"Caption":"Figure 2: From left to right (in each row): observed image with regions indicated by the user as belonging to each class, segmentation result, region boundaries. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We illustrate the semi-supervised mode of our approach on two real RGB images, shown in Fig. 2.\nEach region is modelled by a single multivariate Gaussian density in RGB space. In the example\nin the first row, the goal is to segment the image into skin, cloth, and background regions; in the\nsecond example, the goal is to segment the horses from the background. These examples show how\nthe semi-supervised mode of our algorithm is able to segment the image into regions which \u201Clook\nlike\u201D the seed regions provided by the user.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,524,700,554],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[209,236,641,509]}
