We \nidentify the message as a question if any match is found. Note that \nall matching we perform is case-insensitive. Figure 2 shows a \npartial list of the rules used. We have also created a set of rules to \ntry and eliminate phrases that should not be considered questions, \nbut that match at least one of the rules (these can be regarded as \n\u2018false-positives\u2019). These are mostly questions that serve the \npurpose of negotiating the availability of the user. Figure 3 shows \na few of the rules used. Although this method of identifying \nquestions is not foolproof, it seems to work fairly well in practice. \n"],"Page":3,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[483,448,722,476],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[439,375,584,442]}
