algorithm outlined in Figure 3 defines the operation of all re-\nlay nodes other than the two nodes \u0017 and ﬁ respectively connected\nto the source and destination. Node \u0017 has its state variable U per-\nmanently set to\nﬁ\nﬃNVW\u000B and node ﬁ has X permanently set to ﬁ ﬃNVW\u000B .\nOther than this, the operation of nodes \u0017 and ﬁ is identical to that of\nall the other relays.\nA state transition diagram describing the asynchronous algorithm\nfor nodes \u0012 through ﬁDl \u0017 is shown in Figure 4. We omit the slightly\ndifferent but straightforward diagram for nodes \u0017 and ﬁ . The sys-\ntem starts in the state in which nodes are stationary and informed of\nthe positions of their neighbors. The state variables + , U , and X\nrespectively represent the state of moving and of having fresh posi-\ntion information for the left and right neighbors. In the diagram, we\nabuse notation a bit and represent by o r the reception of a message\ncontaining the position of node \u0000 , signaling that node \u0000 has stopped\nmoving; by Y r the reception of a message indicating that node \u0000 is\nmoving; and by ZN[ the action of sending message [ .\nSince this is an asynchronous protocol, one potential concern is\nthat it could cause deadlock. The proposition below shows that if\nmessages can be reliably transmitted, then our asynchronous proto-\ncol is deadlock free. If messages can be dropped, then we can use\na reliable transport protocol to guarantee reliability; or if each node\nin quiescent mode periodically transmits its position and a transmis-\nsion arrives after finite number of retransmissions, there will still be\nno deadlock.\n","The next issue is that the optimal position of a junction node may\nnot be the average of its neighbors. This is the case because the op-\ntimal position of a node serving as a relay between more than two\nneighbors depends on the power model. Consider the power model\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0006\u0005#\u0007 \u0003\u0010\u000F\n. For \u0011\n\u0007\n\u0012 , we can show that the energy minimiz-\ning position for a relay node between multiple sources and desti-\nnations carrying equal amounts of traffic is always the average of\nthe positions of its neighbors. However, this is only a special case.\nFor \u0011\u0003\u0002 \u0012 , the average is no longer always an optimal solution.\nFigure 14 illustrates this point with an example of placing a single\nrelay between four nodes. To minimize total energy usage under\na cost function quadratic in distance, the optimal point is p; but as\n\u0011\n\u0003 \u0006\nthe optimal point approaches the point q which minimizes\nthe distance of the maximum distance node.
