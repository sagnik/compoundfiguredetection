Figure 4 shows that, start-\ning from the incorrect initialization, the former decreases the\ninitial error, paying with an increasing number of units, while\nthe latter significantly decreases the number of units, paying\nwith an increasing error. Hence, the performance of the net-\nwork critically depends on the choice of the parameters. The\noptimal parameters obviously depend on the concrete setting,\ne.g. the kind and amount of noise present in the training data,\nand methods for finding them will be investigated in the fu-\nture. For our further experiments we will use the FineBlend 1\nparameters, which resulted from a mixture of intuition and\n(non-exhaustive) comparative simulations.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[486,305,724,319],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[456,77,757,290]}
