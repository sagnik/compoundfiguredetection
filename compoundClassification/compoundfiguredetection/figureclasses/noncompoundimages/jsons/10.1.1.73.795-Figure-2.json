{"Caption":"Figure 2: Toy example of sparsifying rectification produced by the Sparsifying Logistic for different choices of the parameters η and β. The input is a sequence of Gaussian random variables. The output, computed by using eq. 4, is a sequence of spikes whose rate and amplitude depend on the parameters η and β. In particular, increasing β has the effect of making the output approximately binary, while increasing η increases the firing rate of the output signal.

This produces\na sequence of positive values which, for large values of β and small values of η, is characterized\nby brief and punctuate activities in time. This behavior is reminiscent of the spiking behavior of\nneurons. η controls the sparseness of the code by determining the \u201Cwidth\u201D of the time window over\nwhich samples are summed up. β controls the degree of \u201Csoftness\u201D of the function.
