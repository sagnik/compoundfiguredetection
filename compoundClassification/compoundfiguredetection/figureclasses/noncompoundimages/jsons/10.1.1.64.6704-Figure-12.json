Compared to the LSASS and ISystemActivator shellcodes,\nthe exedit distance among RemoteActivation shellcodes was very\nsmall. Judging from the dendrogram, most cluster merges occur\nbelow a distance of 1%. Using this threshold results in two fami-\nlies for the RemoteActivation shellcodes, although the 1.3% inter-\nfamily exedit distance indicates that the families are closely related.\nManual analysis of phylogenies: Manually inspecting the ex-\nploits reveals that the last third (roughly 300 bytes) of the payload\ncontained randomly generated characters selected from lower-case\nletters, except for several fixed characters embedded within the ran-\ndom text. There were also small 2- and 4-byte differences in the\nmain body as well. These random characters accounted for the\nvariation within each family.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,574,407,616],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[78,307,404,538]}
