{"Caption":"Figure 6: (a) Model of basic mail server. Incoming mail is handled by an SMTP process, before being scanned for viruses and spam by the mail scanner, and being de- livered using a second SMTP process. (b) Model of mail server with prioritization. The incoming process places mail in one of two queues depending on the predicted message type. The mail scanner selects messages from the queues using a scheduling algorithm.
