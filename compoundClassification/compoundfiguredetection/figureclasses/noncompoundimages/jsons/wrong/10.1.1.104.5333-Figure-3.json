{"Caption":"Figure 3: Our results have been added to plots reproduced with kind permission from [7]. The plots show mean square test error as a function of active\/pseudo set size M . Top row \u2013 data set kin-40k, bottom row \u2013 pumadyn-32nm1 . We have added circles which show SPGP with both hyperparameter and pseudo-input learning from random initialisation. For kin-40k the squares show SPGP with hyperparameters obtained from a full GP and fixed. For pumadyn-32nm the squares show hyperparameters initialized from a full GP. random, info-gain and smo-bart are explained in the text. The horizontal lines are a full GP trained on a subset of the data.

this is what we do for all of our experiments. To compare our results to other methods\nwe have run experiments on exactly the same data sets as in Seeger et al. [7], following\nprecisely their preprocessing and testing methods. In Figure 3, we have reproduced their\nlearning curves for two large data sets1, superimposing our test error (mean squared).\n","For kin-40k we follow Seeger et al.\u2019s procedure of setting the hyperparameters from the full\nGP on a subset. We then optimize the pseudo-input positions, and plot the results as red\nsquares. We see the SPGP learning curve lying significantly below all three other methods\nin Figure 3. We rapidly approach the error of a full GP trained on 2000 points, using a\npseudo set of only a few hundred points. We then try the harder task of also finding the\nhyperparameters at the same time as the pseudo-inputs. The results are plotted as blue\ncircles. The method performs extremely well for small M , but we see some overfitting\n","For data set pumadyn-32nm, we again try to jointly find hyperparameters and pseudo-\ninputs. Again Figure 3 shows SPGP with extremely low error for small pseudo set size\n\u2013 with just 10 pseudo-inputs we are already close to the error of a full GP trained on 1024\npoints. However, in this case increasing the pseudo set size does not decrease our error. In\nthis problem there is a large number of irrelevant attributes, and the relevant ones need to\nbe singled out by ARD. Although the hyperparameters learnt by our method are reasonable\n(2 out of the 4 relevant dimensions are found), they are not good enough to get down to the\nerror of the full GP. However if we initialize our gradient algorithm with the hyperparam-\neters of the full GP, we get the points plotted as squares (this time red likelihoods > blue\nlikelihoods, so it is a problem of local optima not overfitting). Now with only a pseudo set\nof size 25 we reach the performance of the full GP, and significantly outperform the other\nmethods (which also had their hyperparameters set from the full GP).\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,382,675,503],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[173,99,675,359]}
