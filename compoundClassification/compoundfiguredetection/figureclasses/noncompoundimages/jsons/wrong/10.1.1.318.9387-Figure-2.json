{"Caption":"Figure 2. Left, picture of zebra crosswalk. Right, straight-line seg- ment features extracted from image (superimposed in white). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["are 0).\nIn order to extract line segments we perform a simple\nedge pixel grouping procedure that tracks non-zero edge\npoints in a roughly horizontal direction (within±45◦ of hor-\nizontal) from left to right, and groups connected sets of non-\nzero edge pixels that form a sufficiently straight line in this\ndirection. (Note that our edge grouping procedure is not de-\nsigned to detect line segments that are within ±45◦ of ver-\ntical; restricting our search to near-horizontal segments suf-\nfices for typical viewing conditions, in which the camera is\nheld roughly horizontal, and reduces the amount of compu-\ntation.) Next we attempt to close gaps between neighboring\nsets of grouped pixels when the gaps are sufficiently small\n(up to 5 pixels) and the pixel groups are roughly collinear.\nThe resulting set of segment candidates (an example is\nshown in Fig. 2) is pruned to discard any segment with\nlength less than 20 pixels; usually we obtain up to 100 seg-\nments in a 320x240 image. Each segment is represented by\nthe pixel coordinates of its two endpoints.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,588,398,616],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[117,431,351,586]}
