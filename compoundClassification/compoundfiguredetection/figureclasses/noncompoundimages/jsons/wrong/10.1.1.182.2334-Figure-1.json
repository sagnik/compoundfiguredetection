this work, a configurable system is a generic code base\nand a set of mechanisms for implementing pre-planned varia-\ntions in the code base\u2019s structure and behavior. In practice,\nthese variations are wide-ranging, covering hardware and\noperating system platforms (e.g., Windows vs. Linux), soft-\nware versions (e.g., MySQL 5.0 vs. MySQL 5.1), run-time\nfeatures (e.g., enable\/disable debugging output) and others.\nIn this paper, we are focusing on run-time configuration op-\ntions, which are usually given values via configuration files\nor command-line parameters. A configuration is a mapping\nof configuration options to their settings.\nFigure 1 illustrates several ways that run-time configu-\nration options can be used, and explains why understand-\ning their usage requires fairly sophisticated technology. All\nof these examples come from our experimental subject pro-\ngrams, which are written in C. In this figure, variables con-\ntaining configuration options are shown in boldface.\nThe example in Figure 1(a) shows a section of vsftpd\u2019s\ncommand loop, which receives a command and then uses a\nlong sequence of conditionals to interpret the command and\ncarry out the appropriate action. The example shows two\n","such conditionals that also depend on configuration options\n(all of which begin with tunable in vsftpd). In this case,\nthe configuration options enable certain commands, and the\nenabling condition can either be simply the current setting\nof the option (as on line 1) or may involve an interaction\nbetween multiple options (as on lines 6\u20137).\nNot all options need to be booleans, of course. Figure 1(b)\nshows an example from ngIRCd, in which Conf MaxJoins is\nan integer option that, if positive (line 13), specifies the\nmaximum number of channels a user can join (line 14). In\nthis example, error processing occurs if the user tries to join\ntoo many channels.\nFigure 1(c) shows a different example in which two config-\n","uration options are tested in nested conditionals. This illus-\ntrates that it is insufficient to look at tests of configuration\noptions in isolation; we also need to understand how they\nmay interact based on the program\u2019s structure. Moreover, in\nthis example, if both options are enabled then use servermode\nis set on line 23, and its value is then tested on line 27. This\nshows that the values of configuration options can be indi-\nrectly carried through the state of the program.\nFigure 1(d) shows another example of using configuration\noptions indirectly. Here not text is assigned the result of a\ncomplex test involving configuration options, and is then\nused in the conditional (lines 33\u201334) to change the current\nsetting of two other configuration options (lines 36\u201337).\n","to the path condition, and continues exploring the execution\ntree. Each time Otter encounters a conditional, it actually\ncalls an SMT solver to determine which branches (possibly\nboth) of the conditional are possible based on the current\npath condition.\nThere are a few other interesting things to notice about\nthese execution trees. First, consider the execution paths la-\nbeled (B) and (C). Because we have chosen β to be true on\nthis path, we set x=1, and hence x && input is true, allowing\nus to reach statements 4 and 5. This is analogous to the ex-\nample in Figure 1(c), in which a configuration option choice\nresulted in a change to the program state (setting x=1) that\nallowed us to cover some additional code. Also, notice that\nif input=1, there is no way to reach statement 3, no matter\nhow we set the symbolic values. Hence coverage depends on\nchoices of both symbolic values and concrete inputs.\n","The figures below depict the entire set of interactions due\nto line coverage for each of our subject programs: ngIRCd,\ngrep, and vsftpd. In these graphs, a node is shaded if it\nguarantees coverage on its own, black edges represent inter-\nactions involving just two nodes, and interactions involving\nmore than two nodes are cliques of similarly patterned and\nsimilarly colored edges. Nodes represent one or more option\nsettings; we merged nodes with common neighbors, listing\nall settings the node represents. The ngIRCd options are\nall prefixed with Conf , and similarly the vsftpd options are\nprefixed with tunable ; we omit these prefixes to save space.\nIn each of our programs, there were some settings that\nwere involved in many interactions. In ngIRCd, this is\nListenIPv4=1; in vsftpd, it is a 3-way interaction among\nssl enable=0, local enable=0, and anonymous enable=1; and in\ngrep, it is a 2-way interaction between match words=0 and\nmatch lines=0. For vsftpd and grep, we grouped this key\ninteraction into a single node. Then, to help keep the graphs\nlegible, we omitted the edges incident on these key nodes for\ninteractions involving more than one other node. Instead, in\nFigure 10, interactions involving the key node are marked by\nthin edges while others are marked by thick edges; Figures 11\nand 12 have the roles of thick and thin edges reversed.\nngIRCd is depicted differently than grep and vsftpd; many\nof ngIRCd\u2019s option settings have nearly identical neighbors\nas some other settings, so most options are depicted as a\nsingle node which contains all of the possible values for that\noption.
