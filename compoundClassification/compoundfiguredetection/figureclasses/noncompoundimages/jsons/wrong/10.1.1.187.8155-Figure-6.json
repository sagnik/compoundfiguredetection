{"Caption":"Figure 6. Dense disparity maps produced by our method. We obtained very good results for al- most all data sets except the very textured Map which can be actually easily handled by local meth- ods. For Teddy and Cones, although very limited initial reliable regions are found, the final results are very visually satisfactory. Most object details and surface boundaries are finely recovered, in- cluding the bear and flowers in Teddy, and thin sticks and most cones in Cones, mainly due to the reasonable segmentation and the robust progressive scheme. The only obvious error observed is in the middle left of Cones, caused by an early wrong decision.
