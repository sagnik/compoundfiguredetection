{"Caption":"Figure 5: Confidence values for several source-sensor pairs are plotted over a 30-second motion exercising all joints. The belly source (left column) has a better line-of-sight with the thigh sen- sor (second row), while the hat source (right column) has a better view of the chest sensor (first row). They both see the foot sensor (third row) equally well but for different reasons: the belly source is positioned closer, while the hat source is better oriented.
