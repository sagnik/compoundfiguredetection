We have devel-\noped algorithms to efficiently identify different types of Spa-\ntial Object Association Patterns (SOAP), where SOAPs are\nused to characterize the interaction among different types of\nfeatures (objects) at a given moment. We have identified two\nSOAP types, namely, Clique and Star (Figures 2 (a)-(b)), in\n[17]. Another SOAP type, Sequence (Figure 2(c)), is iden-\ntified in our later work [16]. The framework supports three\nshape representation schemes to capture the geometric prop-\nerties of features. It also supports multiple distance metrics\nto measure distances between spatial objects.\n","A Spatial Object Association Pattern (SOAP) of size h , de-\nnoted as h -SOAP, characterizes the closeTo or isAbove rela-\ntionships among h object types.
