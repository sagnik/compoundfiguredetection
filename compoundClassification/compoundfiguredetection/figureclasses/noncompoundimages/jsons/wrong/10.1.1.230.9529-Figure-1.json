{"Caption":"Figure 1: Statistical properties of natural images in a band-pass domain and their representations with the multivariate t model. (a): Marginal densities in the log domain (images: red solid curve, t model: blue dashed curve). (b): Contour plot of the joint density, p(x1 , x2 ), of adjacent pairs of band-pass filter responses. (c): Contour plot of the optimally fitted multivariate t model of p(x1 , x2 ). (d): Each column of the image correspond to a conditional density p(x1 |x2 ) of different x2 values. (e): The three red solid curves correspond to E(x1 |x2 ) and E(x1 |x2 ) ± std(x1 |x2 ). Blue dashed curves correspond to E(x1 |x2 ) and E(x1 |x2 ) ± std(x1 |x2 ) from the optimally fitted multivariate t model to p(x1 , x2 ).

On the surface, our finding seems to be in contradiction\nwith [23], where it was empirically shown that applying an equivalent form of the DN transform as\nEq.(2) (see Section 3.2) over a pair of input neurons can reduce statistical dependencies. However,\none key yet subtle difference is that statistical dependency is defined as the correlations in the con-\nditional variances in [23], i.e., the bow-tie behavior as in Fig.1(d). The observation made in [23]\nis then based on the empirical observations that after applying DN transform, such dependencies\nin the transformed variables become weaker, while our results show that the statistical dependency\nmeasured by MI in that case actually increases.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,240,700,337],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[148,113,702,239]}
