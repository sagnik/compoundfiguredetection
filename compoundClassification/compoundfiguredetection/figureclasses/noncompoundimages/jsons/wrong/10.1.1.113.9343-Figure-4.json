{"Caption":"Figure 4: Signal Processing. The stored data is processed off-line to yield distance measurements from the analog acoustic data (top), and the rotation rates and accelerations from the digital inertial data (bottom). Top: After isolating the acoustic signal by band-passing the original signal around 40kHz, we compute its power envelope. The inflection points of the power envelope provide a robust indication of detected pulse locations, which in turn provide estimates of distances between ultrasonic sources and microphones. Bottom: The digital signal is isolated by low-passing below 13kHz, after which the scrambling pattern is used to identify the beginnings of different samples. The descrambling and error correction recover the encoded rotation rates and accelerations.
