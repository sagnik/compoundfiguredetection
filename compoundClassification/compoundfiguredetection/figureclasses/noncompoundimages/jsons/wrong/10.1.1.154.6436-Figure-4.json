{"Caption":"Figure 4. Radiance propagation iteration","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We will propagate the directional energy between adjacent faces to neighboring cubes. In Figure 4. \nRadiance propagation  you can see the single propagation iteration for the central cell from adjacent \ncells. Each propagation step for one cell consists of two stages: \n Compute the flux through each face by computing the integral of the outgoing radiance from the \nadjacent cube through this face. \n Add the contribution of collected incident energy to the radiance representation of the current \ncube. We assume that all the energy collected at this face moves only orthogonally to the face. \nThat means that we particularly lose incident \nradiance direction for this individual face. But \nthe overall directional distribution of energy \nremains the same after each propagation step \nfor all cubes, since eventually we propagate \nradiance over the complete solid angle for \neach source cube and redistribute it onto a \nclosed surface, which represents a wave front \napproximation. \n","Thus, SSGI is an orthogonal supplement to the current technique (see Figure 14. Combination with SSGI. \nFrom left to right: pure direct lighting with constant ambient term, light propagation volumes without \nSSGI, light propagation volumes with SSGI. Diffuse lighting accumulation buffer is shown at the bottom \nrespectively.). \n"],"Type":"Figure","Number":4,"Page":15,"CaptionBB":[462,676,743,693],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[432,294,800,672]}
