These refer-\nence traces are collected into a database for future query\nuse. (Figure 1 shows the raw 5 second and 100 mil-\nlisecond throughput data for two wired traces of Ocean\u2019s\nEleven.) Second, we describe a simple Discrete Fourier\nTransform based matching algorithm for querying this\ndatabase and predicting the content being transmitted.\n","We streamed a total of 26 movies from a Slingbox Pro\nto laptop and desktop Windows XP computers running\nthe Slingmedia SlingPlayer. See Table 1. For each movie\nwe streamed the first hour of the movie twice over a\nwired connection and twice over an 802.11GWPA-PSK\nTKIP wireless connection. Each time we used the Wire-\nshark protocol analyzer [43] to capture all of the Sling-\nbox encrypted packets to a file. We split each of these\ntraces into 100-millisecond segments and calculate the\ndata throughput for each segment. We use these 100-\nmillisecond throughput traces as the basis for our eaves-\ndropping analysis. See Figure 1 for two examples of\nthese 100-millisecond traces, as well as two example 5-\nsecond throughput traces.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,270,413,335],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[100,100,414,252]}
