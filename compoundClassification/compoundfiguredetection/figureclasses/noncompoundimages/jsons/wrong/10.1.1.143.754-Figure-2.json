{"Caption":"Figure 2: Example Personal Device Scenario","ImageText":[],"Mention":["A user can introduce UIA devices either to merge his\nown devices into a personal group sharing a common\nnamespace, or to create named links from his own group\nto other users\u2019 personal groups. The following sections\ndescribe these two forms of introduction, and other im-\nportant group management actions, with the help of an\nexample scenario illustrated in Figure 2.\n","Bob now returns home and merges his cell phone with his\nhome phone, as shown at Time 4 in Figure 2. Bob\u2019s home\nphone in turn gossips the cell phone\u2019s group membership\nto Bob\u2019s laptop, so the laptop and cell phone can name\n","Returning to the scenario in Figure 2, Bob loses his cell\nphone at Time 7, and he is not sure whether it was stolen\nor just temporarilymisplaced. If the cell phonewas stolen\nand has no local user authentication such as a password or\nfingerprint reader, the thief might obtain not only Bob\u2019s\ndata on the cell phone itself, but also remote access to\nservices authorized to his personal group via UIA names.\nUIA devices capable of accessing sensitive information\nremotely should therefore provide strong local user au-\nthentication, and should encrypt personal data (including\nUIA state) stored on the device, as Apple\u2019s FileVault does\nfor example [3]. The details of local user authentication\nand encryption are orthogonal to UIA, however.\nTo minimize potential damage if a thief does break into\nBob\u2019s user account on his cell phone, Bob can revoke\nthe cell phone\u2019s ownership of his personal group. If the\ncell phone re-appears and Bob realizes that he just mis-\nplaced it, then he can \u201Cundo\u201D the revocation and return\nthe phone to its normal status. If the cell phone remains\nmissing, however, UIA ensures that no one can remotely\naccess personal information or services on Bob\u2019s other\ndevices via the lost phone once the revocation announce-\nment has propagated to those devices. Similarly, the cell\nphone loses its access to the files Alice shared with Bob\nas soon as Alice\u2019s PC, on which the files reside, learns of\nthe revocation from any of Bob\u2019s remaining devices.\n","Whereas DNS resolution traverses a strictly hierarchi-\ncal tree of \u201Czones\u201D starting from a centrally-managed\nglobal root zone, each UIA device has a unique root for\nresolving UIA names, and users can link UIA groups to\nform arbitrary graphs. After Bob meets Alice at Time 3 in\nFigure 2, for example, Bob\u2019s \u201Croot\u201D group for UIA name\nresolution, corresponding to his personal group, appears\nto Alice as a \u201Csub-group\u201D named Bob. Conversely, Al-\nice\u2019s \u201Croot\u201D group appears to Bob as a \u201Csub-group\u201D named\nAlice. Since Bob\u2019s and Alice\u2019s naming relationship\nforms a cycle in the graph of UIA groups, Bob could for\nexample refer to his own phone via the redundant name\nphone.Bob.Alice.\n","at the events in the example scenario from Figure 2. The\nfollowing section will then explain how devices evaluate\nthe contents of their logs to determine the effective state\nof each group at any point in time.\n"],"Type":"Figure","Number":2,"Page":4,"CaptionBB":[142,969,368,982],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[96,120,420,962]}
