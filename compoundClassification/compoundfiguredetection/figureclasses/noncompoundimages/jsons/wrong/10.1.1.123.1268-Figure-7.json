The flush on PSM policy ap-\npears to have a slight negative effect, increasing file sys-\ntem energy usage for all values of queue delay greater\nthan a few seconds. The flush on write policy has no no-\nticeable impact, using essentially the same energy as the\ndefault policy. We have also observed that neither policy\nhas a significant effect on trace replay time.\n","The effect of queue delay in Figure 7 is also strik-\ning. While all six traces show considerable benefit\nfrom setting queue delay greater than zero, no trace\nshowed more than a trifling benefit from increasing\nqueue delay beyond two seconds. This came as a com-\nplete surprise to us (the creators of BlueFS), since we\nexpected the effect of queue delay to mirror that of\nage buffer for ext2.\n"],"Page":11,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[100,356,400,367],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[113,103,427,350]}
