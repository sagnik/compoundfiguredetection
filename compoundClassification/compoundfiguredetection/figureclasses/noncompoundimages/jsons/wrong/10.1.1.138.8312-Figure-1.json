The images are acquired from a set of cameras near the center of the conference\nroom (see Figure 1). The practical challenge is to steer a synthetic virtual camera toward\nthe location of the speaker. The focus here is on person detection; determination of the\nperson who is speaking is beyond the scope of this paper.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[173,278,675,323],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[173,99,687,260]}
