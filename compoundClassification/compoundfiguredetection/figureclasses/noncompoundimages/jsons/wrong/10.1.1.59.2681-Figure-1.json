It sup-\nports a number of log input types such as W3C, IIS, NCSA, \nODBC logs in typical or extended format. An HTML parser and a \nlink crawler were implemented, hence, given the homepage of a \nwebsite the link structure is discovered. Furthermore, the user can \nprovide, in the corresponding window, the website logfile. The \nlogfile is analysed to discover \u201CMaximal Forward Paths\u201D and \n\u201CForward Paths\u201D, as defined in [1]. The user can choose to display \nthe site graph and the most frequent paths, each with a different \ncolour. Frequent paths can be highlighted either on top of the \nWebsite layout or be presented standalone. In this way, possible \nrecommendations can be identified quickly and directly on the site \nvisual representation. \n","The above algorithm can gracefully adjust to multiple levels of \ngranularity. After setting the threshold at the first path-elimination \nstep, then after each vertex-elimination, one can define a higher \nthreshold to correspond to more important paths, and so on. In the \nvisualization tool the three most popular paths are coloured \n(observe the lightly shaded paths at left fig of Figure 1). \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[125,273,724,289],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[119,74,732,271]}
