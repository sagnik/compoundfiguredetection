{"Caption":"Figure 1. Decision regions for various multinomial logistic regression classifiers on multi-class ROC surface. Grey scale background shows the class to which a point would be assigned. Black lines show the ideal equal-cost decision boundary. Symbols show actual training data. Left: Parameters corresponding to minimum total misclassification error on the training data. Middle: Decision regions corresponding to the minimum C21 and C23 and conditioned on this, minimum C31 and C13 . Right: Decision regions corresponding to minimising C12 and C32 .
