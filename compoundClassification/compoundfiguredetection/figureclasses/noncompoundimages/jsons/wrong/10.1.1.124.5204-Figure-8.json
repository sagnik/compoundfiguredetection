{"Caption":"Figure 8. Examples of face and brain surfaces under gaussian noise with different σ set to 0.0 and 2.0 mm, re- spectively. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The second experiment tests the robustness of conformal\ngeometric maps in the presence of noise. We add gaus-\nsian noise(N (0, σ)) on each vertex of the face and brain\nsurfaces. σ increases from 0.0 mm to 2.0 mm while the\nwindow size for computing the curvatures of 3D face and\nbrain surfaces is 10.5 mm. Example surfaces with noise\nunder two different σ are shown in Fig. 8. We match the\nvarious noisy surfaces to the original noise-free surface and\nthe average matching results of the face and brain surfaces\nare shown in Fig. 9 for various σ values.
