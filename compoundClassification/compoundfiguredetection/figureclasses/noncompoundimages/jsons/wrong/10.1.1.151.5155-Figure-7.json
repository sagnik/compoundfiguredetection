{"Caption":"Figure 7: Back lit bumpy sphere with four rendering algorithms. The straight-line approximation cannot capture the volume caus- tics. Path tracing required replacing the point light with a small area source and even with 32 768 samples per pixel (compute time: 1.4 hours) produces a very noisy result (white region is a reflec- tion of the area source). The photon map is much better and takes roughly equal time as our result, but even with ten million photons, it still blurs out the finer details of the caustics as shown in the bot- tom row zoom-in. Our algorithm is able to capture these fine details without the high memory or time requirements of the other methods.
