{"Caption":"Figure 6: NP-hardness reduction from Not-All-Equal 3SAT to the offline multiaccess problem. Black dots form the input; squares are possible points to add that satisfy the set. A wire has two equal- cost choices, the light and dark squares, representing false and true, respectively. A variable can be represented by a wire split into a copy for each use. (Extra ends can be ended, taking care to balance the light and dark costs.) The shift gadget enables arbitrary fixing of parities and negation of wires. The crossover gadget lets wires cross. (Planar Not-All-Equal 3SAT can be solved in polynomial time.) The Not-All-Equal clause gadget has nine squares in the center (white and doubled), requiring at least 9\/2 = 5 to be added; a total of six of these squares (all three whites) must be added if and only if all three doubled squares of the same color have been chosen by the incident wires.
