If a large set of files all contained the\nsame chunk, for example a regularly occurring sequence in\na set of log files, the loss of this small chunk would result\nin the loss of a large set of files. Figure 14 shows the num-\nber of files dependent on shared chunks for the same set of\nfiles used in Figure 13, stored using PRESIDIO with only\nchunk-based compression. The large peak for chunks with\none reference shows the number of unique chunks, and the\npeaks seen at 10, 20, 30 and 40 occur since the files are 10\nversions of the Linux kernel source. Of the 200,635 chunks\nstored, only 89,181 were unique, with an average of five\nfiles referencing a chunk. The data extends out to 2,765 ref-\nerences to a single chunk, however, it was truncated to 41\nfor the graph in the interest of space. There were 72 chunks\nnot shown with more than 41 references, 17 of which were\nover 100.\n","The problem of reliability becomes much more interest-\ning when data is stored in a compressed format. How do\nwe reintroduce redundancy (for reliability) after we have\nworked so hard to remove it? Now that files share data due\nto inter-file compression, a small device failure may result\nin a disproportionately large data loss if a heavily shared\npiece of data is on the failed component. This makes some\npieces of data inherently more valuable than others. In the\ncase of using delta compression for stored files, a file may\nbe the reference file for a number of files, and in turn those\nmay be a reference file for another set of files. A single file\nmay quickly become the root of a large dependency graph,\nas shown in Figure 12. If a file for which other files de-\npended on was lost, all the files with a path to it in the de-\npendency graph would be lost as well. Figure 13 shows\nthe chain lengths for a real set of highly similar data (ten\nLinux kernel sources) stored using PRESIDIO with only\ndelta compression. The average chain length for the set of\nfiles was 5.83, but more interestingly, there were only five\nreference files (chain length zero) for this file set. In other\nwords, in the set of 88,323 files, all of the files depended on\nfive files.\nSub-file chunking also forms inter-file dependencies.\nThe dependencies created when using this method are\n"],"Page":10,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[143,559,346,577],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[100,304,365,542]}
