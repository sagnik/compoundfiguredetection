this work we implement the first group signature scheme with a single-message and signature-\nresponse join protocol to be exploited for concurrent joins and other advantages as above, thus im-\nplementing efficiently the Camenisch-Stadler approach for the first time1.\nWe start by presenting the first model of \u201Cgroup signature with concurrent joins\u201D which builds\non the recent formal models and consists of a set of attacks. We note that in a privacy primitive\ninteracting users may be conducting simultaneous attacks against each other and these need to be\ncaptured formally. We call our attacks: misidentification attack, framing attack and anonymity attack\nand is an extension of our sequential-join formal model for group signatures in [27]. We then implement\na scheme based on specific assumptions and prove its security. The scheme allows adversarial opening\nof signatures and its signature size is only about twice the size of the scheme of [2] (that did not allow\nfor adversarial opening or concurrent join attacks).\nFrom a technical viewpoint we employ a number of complex primitives including the digital sig-\nnature scheme of Boneh and Boyen [8] (hence referred to as the BB signature) as well as verifiable\nencryption for discrete-logarithms that are based on the Paillier encryption function [31, 21, 16, 24].\nA novelty of our technical approach (and perhaps a partial explanation why we manage to achieve\nan efficient single-message and signature-response join) is that we deviate from most of recent group\nsignature literature by instantiating the one-way function employed by the prospective user during the\njoin with multiplication instead of exponentiation. Our general design approach is outlined in figure\n1: users sample an RSA modulus and then obtain a short chain of BB certificates on it (numbering\nfrom one to five signatures). This modest interaction (which is simply a PKI registration in a domain\nemploying RSA moduli with a BB signature for certification) allows users to sign as group members.\nOur security proofs follow a modular approach: in a nutshell, a misidentification adversary is turned\ninto a BB-forger, a framing adversary is turned into a factoring algorithm and an anonymity attacker\nis turned into a CCA2 adversary against the encryption algorithm we employ. The group signature\nitself is based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm, by essentially turning an identity escrow (anonymous\nidentification) system into a signature and employing a random oracle. We note that the interactive\nversion of our group signature yields an identity escrow scheme in a straightforward manner that can\nalso have concurrent group signing by employing general transformation techniques for Î£-protocols,\ne.g. [23].\n"],"Page":5,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,374,720,408],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[146,111,678,324]}
