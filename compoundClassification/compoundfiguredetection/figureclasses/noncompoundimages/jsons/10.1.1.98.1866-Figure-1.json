To generate more complex sig-\nnals, multimodal systems decompose their output \ninto several sub-streams \u2013 we\u2019ll refer to these as \n\u201Cchannels.\u201D  Dividing a communication signal into \nchannels can make it easier to represent the various \nchoices the generator must make; generally, a dif-\nferent processing component of the system will \ngovern the output of each channel.  The trade-off is \nthat these channels must be coordinated over time.   \nInstead of thinking of channels as dividing a \ncommunication signal, we can think of them as \ngroupings of individual values in the data stream \nthat are related in some way.  The channels of a \nmultimodal NLG system generally correspond to \nnatural perceptual\/conceptual groupings called \n\u201Cmodalities.\u201D  Coarsely, audio and visual parts of \nthe output are thought of as separate modalities.  \nWhen parts of the output appear on different por-\ntions of the display, then they are also generally \nconsidered separate modalities.  For instance, a \nmultimodal NLG system for automobile driving \ndirections may have separate processing channels \nfor text, maps, other graphics, and sound effects.  \nAn ECA system may have separate channels for \neye gaze, facial expression, manual gestures, and \nspeech audio of the animated character.   \nWhen a language has no commonly-known writ-\ning system \u2013 as is the case for ASL \u2013 then it\u2019s not \npossible to build a text-based NLG system.  We \nmust produce an animation of a character (like an \nECA) performing ASL; so, we must specify how \nthe hands, eye gaze, mouth shape, facial expres-\nsion, head-tilt, and shoulder-tilt are coordinated \nover time.  With no conventional string-encoding \nof ASL (that would compress the signal into a sin-\ngle stream), an ASL signal is spread over multiple \nchannels of the output \u2013 a departure from most \nMultimodal NLG systems, which have a single \nlinguistic channel\/modality that is coordinated with \nother non-linguistic resources (Figure 1). \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[435,90,739,105],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,112,744,282]}
