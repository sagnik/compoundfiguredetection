{"Caption":"Figure 3: High-level view of Controller components.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The Controller is the brain of the network and has many tasks;\nFigure 3 gives a block-diagram. The components do not have to\nbe co-located on the same machine (indeed, they are not in our\nimplementation).\nBriefly, the components work as follows. The authentication\ncomponent is passed all traffic from unauthenticated or unbound\nMAC addresses. It authenticates users and hosts using credentials\nstored in the registration database. Once a host or user authenti-\ncates, the Controller remembers to which switch port they are con-\nnected.\nThe Controller holds the policy file, which is compiled into a fast\nlookup table (see ยง4). When a new flow starts, it is checked against\nthe rules to see if it should be accepted, denied, or routed through a\nwaypoint. Next, the route computation uses the network topology\nto pick the flow\u2019s route. The topology is maintained by the switch\nmanager, which receives link updates from the Switches.\nIn the remainder of this section, we describe each component\u2019s\nfunction in more detail. We leave description of the policy language\nfor the next section.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[99,286,377,299],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[113,73,369,271]}
