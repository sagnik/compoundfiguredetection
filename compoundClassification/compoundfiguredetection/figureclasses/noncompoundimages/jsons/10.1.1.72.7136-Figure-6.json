{"Caption":"Figure 6: Overall system timings for 28 benchmark queries, ordered by running time, for sample sizes of 100, 1,000, and 5,000 documents, with k = 5. To make the scale of all three lines visible, we show times for 100 and 1,000 documents on the left axis, and for 5,000 documents on the right axis. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["both values of k, it is clear that certain query types have\nsignificantly higher processing times than others. These\nqueries have more compute-intensive f functions, which\ndominate the runtime of the queries that take more than\none minutes.\nFigure 6 shows aggregate end-to-end timings of the en-\ntire system, from the network requests to generate the data\nand metadata, to the time to compute the optimal PDC in\nthe query engine. For 100 documents, all queries complete\nin under five seconds, and most complete in under a sec-\nond. For 1,000 documents, most queries complete in under\n10 seconds, but some require as much as 40 seconds over-\nall. For 5,000 documents, most queries complete in under a\nminute, and some require as much as three minutes. Higher\nquery times are dominated by the query engine processing,\nsuggesting that further algorithmic work and query engine\ntuning is an appropriate direction to improve performance.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[88,711,415,804],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[86,443,420,696]}
