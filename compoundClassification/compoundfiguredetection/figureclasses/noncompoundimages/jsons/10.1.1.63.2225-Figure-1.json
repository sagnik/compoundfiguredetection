When our \nhypothesis is applied to the Interruption domain, it allows \nus to forecast best and worst moments for interruption. \nPredicted best points for interruption correspond to \nmoments during breakpoints between fine-units with a large \ndegree of agreement. Predicted worst points correspond to \nmoments during fine-units with a small degree of \nagreement.
