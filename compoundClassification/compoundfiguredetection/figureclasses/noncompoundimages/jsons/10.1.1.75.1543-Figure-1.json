{"Caption":"Figure 1: Sample network generated by the bipartite                           -model. Buyers and sellers are labeled by \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018S\u2019 respectively, followed by an index indicating the time step at which they were introduced to the network. The solid edges in the figure show the exchange subgraph \u2014 those pairs of buyers and sellers who actually exchange currency and goods at equilibrium. The dotted edges are edges of the network that are unused at equilibrium because they represent inferior prices for the buyers, while the dashed edges are edges of the network that have competitive prices, but are unused at equilibrium due to the specific consumption plan required for market clearance. Each seller is labeled with the price they charge at equilibrium. The example exhibits non-trivial price variation (from 2.00 down to 0.33 per unit good). Note that while there appears to be a correlation between seller degree and price, it is far from a deterministic relation, a topic we shall examine later.
