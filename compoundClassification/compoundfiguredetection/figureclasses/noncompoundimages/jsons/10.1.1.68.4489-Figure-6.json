{"Caption":"Figure 6: How Doppelganger determines a cookie policy for a domain during the mirroring process. When Doppelganger detects a difference between the main and fork windows, it prompts the user to decide whether the additional features are worth the potential privacy risk. Doppelganger makes an automatic policy decision if it does not detect any differences after max steps page loads. We omit some additional transitions present in low and medium paranoia modes (see Section 3.4).
