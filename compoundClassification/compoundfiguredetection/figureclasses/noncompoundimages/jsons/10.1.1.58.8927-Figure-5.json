We have also implemented the Client\nConduit protocol and the Rogue AP detection mechanism. The sup-\nport for DIAL and EDEN is currently being added.\nOur system has been implemented on the Windows operating sys-\ntem with Netgear MA 521 802.11b cards. On the DS, we simply run\na daemon process that accepts information from DAPs. The DS reads\nthe list of legitimate APs from a file; support for reading this informa-\ntion from a database can be easily added. The structure of the code\non the DC or DAP consists of a user-level daemon and kernel level\ndrivers (see Figure 5). These pieces are structured such that code is\nadded to the kernel drivers only if the functionality cannot be achieved\nin the user-level daemon or if the performance penalty is too high.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[141,343,351,356],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[142,61,352,327]}
